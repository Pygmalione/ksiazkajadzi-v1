# Story 8: Temperature Wars - Ondol vs. Polish Heating

## Version 1: "Reportaż intymny, ale z pazurem" (5400-7000 words)

### The Floor That Started a War

Jadzia Kim here, your favorite Korean-Chinese cultural translator, watching yet another Polish-Korean couple discover that love isn't just about hearts and flowers – sometimes it's about heated floors and frozen toes.

When Maja first stepped into Hyun-woo's Seoul apartment that November evening, she thought the floor heating was broken. "Why is the floor on fire?" she asked, immediately hopping onto the sofa like the ground was lava. Hyun-woo stared at her, genuinely confused. In his world, a properly heated floor in winter was as essential as kimchi in the fridge.

"It's ondol," he explained, watching her press her palms against the wall as if checking for hidden flames. "Korean floor heating. It's... normal?"

Normal. That word would become their relationship's biggest joke and deepest divide.

### The First Winter

I met Maja at a Polish-Korean cultural exchange event in Warsaw, where she was frantically fanning herself despite the December cold. "You don't understand," she said, downing her third glass of water. "He keeps the floor at 30 degrees. THE FLOOR. Who heats the floor?"

Her story unfolded like a comedy of thermal errors. Maja, raised in a Polish household where radiators ruled and floors were acceptably cold, had fallen for Hyun-woo during his exchange semester in Warsaw. Their romance bloomed over pierogi and kimchi, late-night study sessions, and walks along the Vistula. Temperature hadn't been an issue – Polish spring was mild, their love was hot, and nobody was lying on any floors.

Then came the invitation to visit his family in Seoul.

"The first night, I couldn't sleep," Maja recalled, her hands gesturing wildly. "The floor was so hot, I felt like a piece of meat on a grill. I tried opening the window – he closed it. I tried sleeping on top of the blanket – he got me a thicker one. I finally dragged a chair into the bathroom and slept sitting up. In the morning, his mother found me there and almost cried. She thought I was sick!"

Hyun-woo's perspective was equally baffled. We talked over coffee in Warsaw's Koreatown, where he was now working at a tech startup. "In Korea, warm floors mean love," he explained, wrapping his hands around his mug as if still seeking that familiar heat. "My grandmother used to say, 'Cold floor, cold heart.' When Maja complained about the heat, my family thought... they thought maybe she didn't feel comfortable with us."

The misunderstanding had deeper roots than either initially realized. In Korean culture, ondol isn't just heating – it's a lifestyle. Families gather on the warm floor, sleeping on thin mats, eating at low tables, their bodies in constant contact with that radiating warmth. It's communal, intimate, a embrace from the home itself.

Polish heating culture, by contrast, is vertical. Radiators on walls push heat into the air. Floors remain cool, even cold. You wear slippers, thick socks. The heat comes to you; you don't go to the heat.

### The Bed Wars

If the floor was their first battlefield, the bed became their second.

"He wanted to sleep on the floor," Maja told me, still incredulous two years later. "On. The. Floor. Like, voluntarily. With a perfectly good bed right there!"

Traditional Korean sleeping meant a yo (thin mattress) laid directly on the heated floor. Even in modern apartments with beds, many Koreans still prefer floor sleeping, especially when sick or seeking comfort. The ondol's warmth penetrates tired muscles, aching joints. It's therapeutic, nostalgic, profoundly comfortable – if you're Korean.

"I tried," Hyun-woo said, laughing at the memory. "I bought the thickest mattress I could find in Poland. But your floors... they're ice! Even with carpets, even with heating on full blast, the cold comes through. I lasted one night on the floor and thought I'd die."

Their apartment became a testament to thermal compromise. The bedroom had the highest bed IKEA sold ("So far from the frozen floor," Hyun-woo joked), piled with Polish goose-down comforters. But they also had a "Korean room" – a small space with portable floor heating mats where Hyun-woo could retreat when his back hurt or he felt homesick.

"Sometimes I find him there at 3 AM," Maja admitted, her voice softening. "Curled up on his thin mat, looking so peaceful. I tried joining him once. Lasted ten minutes before my hip bones screamed for mercy. How do Koreans not have skeleton problems?"

### The Radiator Revelation

Their first winter in their shared Warsaw apartment brought new challenges. Polish radiators, those cast-iron monoliths attached to walls, bewildered Hyun-woo.

"Why is all the heat going up?" he asked, standing on a chair to feel the warm air near the ceiling. "Heat rises, yes, but why don't we use it where we are?"

He had a point. Polish apartments often feature hot ceilings and cold floors, with residents huddled in the middle layer where warm and cold air reluctantly mingle. Hyun-woo's engineering mind couldn't accept this inefficiency.

"He tried to redirect the heat," Maja recounted, showing me photos on her phone. "Blankets draped over radiators to push heat down. Fans on the floor pointing up. Once, I came home to find he'd built a tent over the radiator with our dining chairs and bedsheets. He was sitting inside it, laptop and all, working in his homemade heat cave."

The neighbors complained about the fire hazard. The landlord threatened eviction. But Hyun-woo was a man on a mission.

"In Korea, we have saying," he told me. "'Deung ttatteutago bae gopeuji.' Warm back, full belly. But here, my back is always cold. How can I be happy with cold back?"

### The Mother-in-Law Incident

The real test came when Hyun-woo's mother visited Warsaw that February. Mrs. Park, a formidable woman who'd raised three children in a traditional hanok house with original ondol, took one step into their apartment and declared it "unfit for human habitation."

"She wore her coat indoors for three days," Maja said, the trauma still fresh. "Her entire coat. Scarf, gloves, everything. She looked like she was waiting for a bus in our living room."

Mrs. Park's visit became a crash course in Korean thermal expectations. She brought electric heating pads, placing them strategically on every seat. She wore multiple layers of thermal underwear that she'd also brought for Maja ("Korean daughter-in-law must be warm," she'd insisted, pressing packages of heat-tech clothing into Maja's bewildered hands). She commandeered the kitchen, making endless pots of steaming soup and tea.

"She kept checking my hands," Maja remembered. "If they were cold, she'd grab them and rub them between hers, looking at Hyun-woo like he was failing in his duties. I started wearing gloves indoors just to avoid the hand temperature checks."

The breaking point came when Mrs. Park discovered Maja's morning routine.

"I like cold showers," Maja explained to me. "Always have. It wakes me up, makes me feel alive. Polish way – quick cold shower, then warm clothes."

For Mrs. Park, this was tantamount to self-torture. Korean bathing culture revolves around long, hot soaks. Public jjimjilbangs (bathhouses) feature multiple pools of increasingly hot water. The idea of voluntarily subjecting oneself to cold water in winter was incomprehensible.

"She staged an intervention," Hyun-woo recalled, shaking his head. "Called my aunts in Seoul. Had them on video chat, all lecturing Maja about the importance of keeping the body warm. My cousin even sent scientific articles about the benefits of hot baths. In Korean, which Maja couldn't read."

### Finding Middle Ground

Like many couples navigating cultural differences, Maja and Hyun-woo's thermal wars eventually led to negotiation and innovation. They discovered compromises in unexpected places.

"We got a water bed," Maja announced proudly. "Heated. It's like sleeping on warm jello. Hyun-woo gets his heat from below, I get my soft mattress. Win-win."

They also invested in zone heating. The apartment was divided into thermal territories: Maja's cool zones (bedroom set to 18°C, her home office positively arctic at 16°C) and Hyun-woo's warm zones (his office at 25°C, the Korean room at a toasty 28°C). The living room was neutral territory, maintained at 21°C – "The DMZ," Hyun-woo called it.

"We have rules now," Maja explained. "No touching the thermostat in each other's zones. No complaining about clothing choices – if he wants to wear a parka in my office, that's his right. And absolutely no more tent-building over radiators."

They even found ways to blend their thermal cultures. Korean electric blankets became winter staples, but used Polish-style on the sofa while watching TV, not on the floor. They discovered jjimjilbangs in Warsaw, where Maja slowly learned to appreciate the meditative quality of hot baths, though she still snuck in cold showers when Hyun-woo wasn't looking.

### The Deeper Warmth

What struck me most about their story wasn't the comic mishaps or cultural clashes, but how temperature became a metaphor for deeper differences in their relationship.

"In Korea, warmth is communal," Hyun-woo reflected. "We share heat, literally. Families sleep together on warm floors. It's about being close, removing barriers. Polish heating feels... individual to me. Everyone in their own warm bubble, not touching."

Maja nodded slowly. "And for us, maybe the cold is communal. We complain about winter together, share the suffering. When spring comes, we celebrate together. The cold makes us tough, but also brings us together in different ways."

Their temperature negotiations revealed fundamental differences in concepts of comfort, privacy, and care. For Hyun-woo, keeping Maja warm was an act of love. For Maja, respecting her temperature preferences was recognizing her autonomy.

"I realized," Maja said, "that when I rejected his heat, he heard 'I reject your care.' And when he kept making it warmer, I heard 'I don't respect your choices.' We were both wrong. And both right."

### The Universal Cold War

Every mixed couple I've interviewed has their version of the temperature wars. My friend Yuki from Japan married a Polish guy who keeps their house at what she calls "meat locker temperatures." A Korean-British couple in London engages in nightly battles over the electric blanket setting. A Polish woman in Seoul started a successful business selling "cooling vests" to other expats surviving Korean summer floor heating that never quite turns off.

It's funny how something as basic as temperature preference can reveal so much about cultural values. Koreans often see Polish cold tolerance as almost masochistic. Poles view Korean heat obsession as excessive, even wasteful. Yet both cultures developed their approaches from centuries of adaptation to their environments and available resources.

### The New Generation

Maja and Hyun-woo are expecting their first child now. The nursery has become a new battlefield of thermal negotiations.

"Korean babies sleep on heated floors," Hyun-woo insisted, showing me pictures of traditional Korean nurseries.

"Polish babies need fresh air," Maja countered, pulling up articles about Nordic babies napping outdoors in winter.

They've compromised: a firm mattress on a slightly warm floor, with a window cracked for fresh air. The baby will wear Korean thermal underwear under Polish wool clothing. The room temperature is set to 22°C – warmer than Maja prefers, cooler than Hyun-woo wants.

"Our child will be thermally confused," Maja joked. "Comfortable everywhere, or comfortable nowhere."

But perhaps that's the gift of multicultural children – the ability to adapt, to find comfort in different environments, to understand that there's no one right way to be warm.

### Winter Wisdom

As I write this in my own Warsaw apartment (heated to a compromise 20°C that pleases neither my Korean mother nor my Polish neighbors), I think about all the couples navigating their own temperature wars.

The lesson isn't that one culture's approach is better. It's that our deepest comforts – the things we take for granted as "normal" – are learned, cultural, negotiable. Love doesn't mean always being comfortable. Sometimes it means being uncomfortable together, finding new ways to create warmth.

Maja and Hyun-woo still argue about temperature. She still sneaks cold showers. He still builds heat forts with space heaters and blankets. But now they laugh about it. They've learned each other's thermal languages, even if they'll never be native speakers.

"You know what's funny?" Maja told me as we finished our interview. "I visited my parents last week. Their house felt cold. Actually cold. I kept checking if the heating was on. My mother said, 'You've gone Korean.' Maybe she's right. Maybe love is slowly teaching my body a new definition of comfort."

And maybe that's what successful intercultural relationships do – they don't erase our differences, but they expand our capacity for comfort, teaching us that warmth comes in many forms, at many temperatures, from many sources.

Even if some of those sources are floors that feel like they're powered by the earth's core.

## Version 2: "Komedia totalna" (7500-9000 words)

### The Great Warsaw Floor Heating Incident of 2023

Listen up, because I'm about to tell you the most ridiculous story of cultural clash you've never imagined could happen. It involves a Korean boy, a Polish girl, several traumatized radiators, one confused landlord, three emergency plumber visits, and a DIY ondol system that nearly burned down a Mokotów apartment building.

I'm Jadzia Kim, and I've seen some things in my six years of Korean-Polish cultural translation. But nothing – NOTHING – prepared me for the thermal nuclear war between Min-jun and Agnieszka.

### Act I: Boy Meets Girl, Girl Meets Floor

Picture this: Min-jun, fresh off the plane from Busan, arriving in Warsaw in October. He's got dreams of European adventure, a software engineering job lined up, and exactly zero preparation for Polish autumn.

His first night in his new apartment, he calls his mother in tears.

"Eomma," he wails, "the floor is trying to kill me."

His mother, being a practical Korean woman, asks the obvious question: "Is it on fire?"

"No! It's the opposite! It's made of ice! Polish people live on ice floors! I'm going to die here!"

Meanwhile, three blocks away, Agnieszka is having her own crisis. She's just returned from a semester in Seoul, and her Polish flat feels wrong. All wrong.

"The heat is in the wrong place," she tells her roommate, Kasia, who stares at her like she's lost her mind.

"What do you mean wrong place? It's coming from the radiator. Where else would it come from?"

"The floor," Agnieszka says dreamily. "In Korea, love comes from the floor."

Kasia checks her for fever. Finding none, she prescribes vodka and tells her to sleep it off.

But fate – that cosmic comedian – has plans. Min-jun and Agnieszka meet at a language exchange meetup. He's seeking Polish lessons, she's trying to maintain her Korean. Their eyes meet across a crowded room, and it's magic.

Well, it's magic until they try to study at his place.

### Act II: The Temperature Tango Begins

"Why," Agnieszka asks, standing in Min-jun's apartment wearing her winter coat indoors, "is it thirty degrees in here?"

Min-jun, wearing shorts and a tank top, shivers. "It's barely twenty-five. I turned it down for you. In Korea, this would be refrigerator temperature."

She stares at the arsenal of space heaters arranged around his apartment like some kind of heating militia. There are seven. SEVEN. In a studio apartment.

"Min-jun," she says slowly, "this is not normal."

"Your frozen floor is not normal," he counters, pointing accusingly at the innocent parquet.

This begins what their friends would later call The Great Temperature Negotiations of Early Relationship. Every date involves complex preparations:

- Meeting at his place: Agnieszka brings a portable fan and cooling vest (yes, she bought a cooling vest)
- Meeting at her place: Min-jun arrives in expedition-grade thermal wear
- Meeting in public: They only go to places with adjustable climate control

Their friends start taking bets on how long they'll last. The smart money is on "until the first real winter."

### Act III: Meeting the Parents (Thermal Edition)

December arrives with a vengeance. Min-jun, in what can only be described as an act of pure optimism or complete insanity, invites Agnieszka to meet his parents.

Who are visiting.

From Busan.

In December.

In Warsaw.

Mrs. Kim steps off the plane wearing what appears to be every item of clothing she owns. Mr. Kim has hand warmers in every pocket. They take one look at their son's Polish girlfriend – wearing a light sweater in -5°C weather – and exchange Concerned Parent Glances.

"Is she... broken?" Mrs. Kim whispers in Korean.

The dinner at Min-jun's apartment is a masterclass in thermal warfare. Mrs. Kim has commandeered the kitchen, creating what can only be described as a sauna. The windows fog. Paint begins to peel. Agnieszka slowly melts into a puddle of regret.

"I'm dying," she texts her friend under the table. "Send help. Or ice."

Mrs. Kim, meanwhile, is wrapping Agnieszka in progressively more layers. "Korean daughter must be warm!" she declares, producing scarves from nowhere like a magician with an unlimited supply of wool.

Mr. Kim has discovered the radiator and is hugging it like a long-lost friend. "In Korea," he announces to no one in particular, "heat comes from floor. Very scientific. Very healthy."

Agnieszka, now wearing approximately seventeen scarves, makes a tactical error. She suggests they go for a walk to see Warsaw's Christmas lights.

The Kims react like she's suggested a polar bear plunge.

"Outside? In winter? For fun?" Mrs. Kim looks at her son. "Is she punishment from ancestors?"

### Act IV: The Ondol Offensive

Spring brings new hope and new insanity. Min-jun, having survived his first Polish winter, decides to take matters into his own hands. He's going to install ondol in his apartment.

"You can't install Korean floor heating in a Polish apartment," Agnieszka says reasonably.

"Watch me," Min-jun replies with the confidence of a man who has never dealt with Polish building regulations.

What follows is a comedy of errors that would make Kafka weep:

**Day 1**: Min-jun orders heating cables from Korea. The package is held at customs because Polish authorities cannot believe anyone would voluntarily import floor heating materials.

**Day 3**: He convinces customs it's for "medical purposes." The definition of medical purposes remains creatively vague.

**Day 7**: Installation begins. Min-jun realizes Polish floors are not designed for heating cables. This does not deter him.

**Day 10**: The first "modification" to the floor begins. His downstairs neighbor, Pan Kowalski, notices his ceiling is warming up.

**Day 12**: Pan Kowalski arrives at Min-jun's door. "Why," he asks in broken English, "is my ceiling sweating?"

**Day 15**: Min-jun installs "just a little" insulation. The floor is now three inches higher. The door no longer closes properly.

**Day 18**: Agnieszka arrives to find Min-jun lying spread-eagle on his newly heated floor, looking like he's achieved nirvana. The apartment is approximately the temperature of Mercury's sunny side.

**Day 20**: The building's electrical system has opinions about Min-jun's modifications. These opinions are expressed through creative sparking and the occasional power outage.

**Day 21**: Emergency electrician visit #1. The electrician takes one look at Min-jun's handiwork and crosses himself.

**Day 23**: The landlord is summoned. He takes one look at the raised floor, the sweating ceiling below, and the electrical "improvements," and speaks the immortal words: "What the ku*wa is this?"

### Act V: The Great Compromise Campaign

With the threat of eviction looming and repair costs mounting, our thermal Romeo and Juliet must find a solution. Enter the greatest minds of Polish-Korean diplomatic relations: the ajummas and babcias.

Min-jun's Korean community mobilizes. Agnieszka's Polish family activates. What follows is a summit meeting that would make the UN jealous.

**The Korean Contingent's Demands**:
- Minimum floor temperature of 25°C
- Acceptance that cold floors cause arthritis, infertility, and general life failure
- Recognition of ondol as a basic human right

**The Polish Brigade's Requirements**:
- Maximum air temperature of 20°C
- Acknowledgment that fresh air prevents disease
- Agreement that wearing socks indoors is perfectly civilized

The negotiations are fierce. Charts are produced showing the health benefits of various temperatures. Someone brings up the Geneva Convention. A Korean grandmother threatens to demonstrate traditional moxibustion. A Polish babcia counters with her cold water therapy testimony.

Finally, Agnieszka's ancient babcia Helena, who survived World War II and communism, speaks:

"In war, we had no heat. We survived. In communism, we had heat two hours a day. We survived. Now you have heat everywhere and complain about where it comes from? Children these days."

Shamed into action, the couple develops The Treaty of Thermal Coexistence:

### The Treaty Terms:

**Article 1**: The Bedroom Accords
- Heated mattress pad set to "Korean Comfort" (28°C)
- Window cracked to "Polish Fresh" (5mm gap minimum)
- Dual zone blankets (electric side for Min-jun, regular for Agnieszka)

**Article 2**: The Living Room Protocols
- Floor heating mats in designated "Korean Zones"
- Ceiling fan on reverse to push heat down from radiators
- No more than 3 space heaters operational simultaneously

**Article 3**: The Bathroom Amendments
- Morning shower schedule: Agnieszka first (cold water), Min-jun second (surface-of-sun temperature)
- Heated bathroom floor tiles (compromise victory for Korea)
- Ventilation fan always on (compromise victory for Poland)

**Article 4**: The Visiting Relatives Clause
- Korean parents visit only May-September
- Polish family visits get warning about apartment temperature
- Emergency cooling/heating equipment rental budget established

### Act VI: The Children Question

Two years into their relationship, the temperature wars have evolved into temperature détente. They've even started joking about it. That's when Agnieszka drops the bomb:

"So, when we have kids..."

Min-jun freezes (ironically). "Kids?"

"Hypothetically," she adds quickly. "How would we handle their temperature needs?"

This sparks The Great Parenting Temperature Debate:

**Min-jun's position**: "Korean babies sleep on warm floors! It's tradition! It's healthy! They'll have strong backs!"

**Agnieszka's stance**: "Polish babies need fresh air! They sleep outside in prams! It builds immunity!"

They consult experts. They read conflicting studies. They poll their friends. They create spreadsheets.

Their friend Tomasz suggests, "Maybe let the kid decide?"

Both stare at him like he's suggested letting the kid join a circus.

"Babies can't decide optimal sleeping temperature!" Min-jun exclaims.

"That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard," Agnieszka agrees.

It's the first thing they've agreed on in the entire temperature debate.

### Act VII: The Housewarming Disaster

They finally move in together, choosing a new apartment that's a "blank thermal slate." The housewarming party will showcase their perfectly balanced Polish-Korean temperature compromise.

The guests arrive to find:
- Name tags with recommended clothing layers based on nationality
- A coat check that's really a "thermal adjustment station"
- Zones marked with tape on the floor: "Tropical Korea," "Arctic Poland," "Neutral Zone," and "DMZ (Drastically Mixed Zone)"

The party starts well. Koreans cluster in Tropical Korea, fanning themselves and complaining it's too cold. Poles gather in Arctic Poland, sweating and insisting it's too hot. A few brave souls venture into the Neutral Zone.

Then someone suggests playing Twister.

The game board is placed in the DMZ.

What happens next enters Polish-Korean legend. As players stretch across thermal zones, chaos erupts. Someone's left foot in Tropical Korea while their right hand is in Arctic Poland. The sudden temperature changes cause confusion. People start sweating on one side of their body while shivering on the other.

"I'm having a stroke!" someone yells.

"No, that's just thermal shock!" Min-jun calls out helpfully.

The game ends when Agnieszka's cousin Marek, stretched between all four zones, declares, "I can taste colors and time has stopped."

The party is deemed a success, mainly because everyone has a story to tell.

### Act VIII: The Miracle Solution

Just when our couple thinks they're doomed to eternal thermal warfare, salvation arrives in an unexpected form: Min-jun's tech startup colleague, Lars from Sweden.

"You're both wrong," Lars declares over beer. "Swedish temperature control is superior."

Min-jun and Agnieszka unite for the first time in their thermal journey – in their mutual offense at this declaration.

"Excuse me?" Agnieszka says, her Polish pride activated.

"What do you know about ondol?" Min-jun demands, his Korean heritage insulted.

Lars smiles. "I know that you're so busy fighting about temperature, you forgot about humidity."

He explains his Swedish triple-zone climate system with separate controls for temperature, humidity, and air flow. It's so complex, so beautifully over-engineered, that both Min-jun and Agnieszka are speechless.

"This is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen," Min-jun whispers, staring at the control panel Lars has sketched.

"It's... it's perfect," Agnieszka agrees, tears in her eyes.

United by their awe of Scandinavian engineering, they finally find common ground. They install the Swedish system (at enormous cost), and for the first time in their relationship, both are thermally satisfied.

### The Epilogue: Thermal Ever After

Five years later, Min-jun and Agnieszka are married with twins. Their apartment is a marvel of climate engineering that would make NASA jealous. They've written a book: "Love at Different Degrees: A Thermal Guide to Intercultural Relationships."

Their children, of course, are thermal mutants. They sleep on heated floors with windows open. They wear shorts in winter and sweaters in summer. They're comfortable everywhere and nowhere, citizens of a new, thermally confused world.

At their wedding, the speeches were legendary:

Min-jun's father: "When my son first told me he was dating a Polish girl who liked cold, I thought he was being punished for not calling his mother enough. Now I know – he was being prepared for climate change."

Agnieszka's mother: "I used to worry my daughter would freeze to death in her own home. Now I worry she'll melt. But at least she's happy. And the grandchildren seem... adaptable."

The couple's first dance was to "Hot N Cold" by Katy Perry, because of course it was.

Their wedding favors? Personalized thermostats.

### The Moral of the Thermal

What did we learn from this ridiculous saga? That love isn't about finding someone who shares your temperature preferences. It's about finding someone worth sweating or shivering for.

It's about compromise – not the kind where everyone's equally miserable, but the kind where you create something new together. Something that works for both of you, even if it requires Swedish intervention and a second mortgage.

It's about learning that there's no "normal" temperature, just like there's no "normal" way to love. What's comfortable for one person is torture for another, and that's okay. The magic happens when you stop trying to convert each other and start building a world where you can both exist comfortably.

And sometimes, just sometimes, it's about accepting that your children will grow up thermally confused but emotionally balanced, citizens of a world where love transcends temperature, culture, and even common sense.

But mostly, it's about never, ever trying to install DIY ondol in a Polish apartment. Trust me on this one.

*[This version maximizes comedy through absurd escalation, slapstick situations, and the ridiculousness of taking temperature preferences to extremes. Every scene builds on the thermal chaos, creating a farcical but ultimately heartwarming tale of love conquering all degrees.]*

## Version 3: "Miejska mozaika chaosu" (9000-11500 words)

### The Witness Testimonies: A Thermal Investigation

Jadzia Kim here, investigative reporter, and today I'm piecing together the most bizarre story of cultural conflict I've encountered in Warsaw's international district. What started as a simple disagreement over room temperature escalated into a neighborhood incident involving five emergency services, twelve witnesses, and one very confused city inspector.

The thing is, everyone saw something different. Every witness tells a different story. But they all agree on one thing: it started with the floor.

### Witness #1: Mrs. Bożena Kowalska, Landlady (Age 67)

"I've been renting apartments for thirty years. Thirty years! I've seen tenants do strange things – one guy kept pigeons in the bathroom, another woman painted all the walls black. But this Korean boy, this Sung-ho... what he did defies explanation.

It started innocently. He signed the lease in September, nice boy, very polite. Bowed a lot. IT company job, good references. I thought, 'Finally, a quiet tenant.'

October, he calls me. 'Mrs. Kowalska,' he says, 'the heating doesn't work.'

I send my husband to check. Heating works perfectly. Twenty-one degrees, like normal.

'No, no,' the boy says, 'the floor heating doesn't work.'

Floor heating? What floor heating? This is a building from 1962. We have radiators, like God intended.

That should have been my first warning.

November, I get a call from the downstairs neighbor. Their ceiling is... warm. Not hot, just warm. Like someone's breathing on it from above. I think maybe a pipe is leaking, send my husband again.

He comes back pale. 'Bożena,' he says, 'you need to see this.'

The boy had... I don't know how to explain. He had cables. Everywhere. Under rugs, under furniture, taped to the floor. The entire apartment looked like the inside of a computer. And the floor – he'd built a platform. A wooden platform, fifteen centimeters high, covering the entire floor.

'For better heating,' he explains, like this is normal. Like everyone builds false floors in rental apartments.

I tell him to remove it. He shows me a PowerPoint presentation. A POWERPOINT! About Korean floor heating and health benefits. Forty-seven slides. With graphs.

I should have evicted him then. But he offered to pay double deposit. And in this economy...

Then came December and the Incident."

### Witness #2: Sung-ho Park, The Tenant (Age 28)

"Nobody understands. In Korea, we have saying: 'Warm floor, warm heart.' It's not just comfort – it's health, life, civilization itself!

I came to Warsaw for work. Good job, good salary. The apartment looked nice in photos. Nobody mentioned the floor would be ice. ICE! First night, I couldn't sleep. My bones hurt. My ancestors were crying.

I called my mother. She said, 'Install ondol.' I explained Polish apartments don't have ondol. She said, 'Then make ondol.' Korean mothers don't accept excuses.

So I researched. Found electric cables online. Very safe, very modern. CE certified! I'm engineer – I know what I'm doing.

The platform was necessary. You can't just put heating cables on cold floor – needs insulation. Basic thermodynamics. I made blueprint, calculated heat distribution. Very scientific.

Mrs. Kowalska overreacted. The downstairs neighbor too. Little bit warm ceiling never hurt anyone. In Korea, we'd consider it bonus feature.

But the real problem wasn't the heating. The real problem was Katarzyna from next door."

### Witness #3: Katarzyna Nowak, Next-Door Neighbor (Age 26)

"Look, I'm not one to complain about neighbors. Warsaw apartments, thin walls, we all hear everything. But this was different.

It started with the smell. This... electronic burning smell. Like when you leave laptop on bed too long. But constant. I thought maybe he was mining Bitcoin or something.

Then my wall started getting warm. The shared wall between our apartments. At first, I thought it was nice – free heating, right? My electricity bill even went down a bit.

But then it got warmer. And warmer. My pictures started sliding down the wall – the adhesive was melting! My chocolate advent calendar turned into chocolate puddle calendar.

I knocked on his door. He answered wearing shorts and tank top. In December! The heat wave that hit me... it was like opening oven door.

'Is everything okay?' I asked.

'Perfect!' he says. 'Finally warm! You want tea?'

I looked inside. He was sitting on the floor – on the floor! – with laptop, working like this was normal. The entire floor was elevated, like a stage. Cables everywhere. It looked like mission control for space station.

'This seems... dangerous,' I said.

He showed me certificates. Safety standards. Temperature readings. He had thermometer guns, humidity sensors. The man was running a climate laboratory.

'In Korea,' he explained, 'we live on floor. Floor must be warm. Polish apartments are designed wrong.'

Designed wrong? These buildings survived communism!

But here's the weird part – I started visiting him. The floor was actually... nice. Like a warm hug for your whole body. We'd sit on the floor, drink tea, watch Korean dramas on his laptop. I started understanding why he needed this.

Then my boyfriend visited, and everything went crazy."

### Witness #4: Tomasz Wiśniewski, The Boyfriend (Age 29)

"I'm a firefighter. I've seen things. House fires, chemical spills, cats in very unusual places. But Kasia's neighbor's apartment broke my brain.

First time I visit, she warns me: 'The neighbor's a bit intense about heating.' I'm thinking maybe he keeps it at 23, 24 degrees. Polish people complain when it's over 21.

I walk in, and it's like entering different climate zone. The humidity hits you first – he had humidifiers running to 'balance the dry heat.' Then the temperature – easily 30 degrees. And the floor...

'Try it,' Kasia says, already sitting cross-legged on this wooden platform thing.

I touch it. It's warm. Really warm. Like heated bathroom floor in fancy hotel, but everywhere.

'This is illegal,' I say immediately. 'Fire hazard. Building code violation. Multiple safety issues.'

The Korean guy – Sung-ho – gets upset. Starts showing me documentation. Korean safety standards. EU compliance certificates. Temperature monitoring system on his phone. The man had thermal cameras set up to monitor heat distribution!

'Look,' he shows me his phone, 'never above 35 degrees floor surface. Very safe. Korean babies sleep on warmer.'

Korean babies? What about Polish fire codes?

But Kasia likes it there. Says it helps her back pain. She's started doing yoga on his warm floor. Yoga! My girlfriend is doing yoga on the neighbor's sketchy heated platform!

I had to act. Public safety and all. But I didn't call it in officially. I called my buddy Marek from building inspection. Unofficially. Just to take a look.

That was mistake number one."

### Witness #5: Marek Zieliński, Building Inspector (Age 45)

"Twenty years in building inspection. I've shut down illegal nightclubs, condemned structures held together by prayer and duct tape. But this... this challenged my understanding of reality.

Tomasz calls me: 'Marek, need you to look at something. Unofficially. Might be fire hazard, might be genius. Can't tell.'

I arrive expecting typical disaster – amateur electrical work, maybe some code violations. What I find is... engineering marvel? Monstrosity? Both?

The tenant, very polite Korean man, greets me with slippers. 'For the warm floor,' he says. I'm thinking, carpeting? No. He means the entire floor is warm. Literally warm.

He gives tour like proud father. Shows me the raised platform – properly ventilated, moisture barriers, expansion gaps for thermal movement. The electrical work is... actually decent? Circuit breakers, proper grounding, temperature limiters.

'I follow Korean building standard,' he explains, showing me folder of documents. 'Also Polish standard where applicable. Some compromise where standards conflict.'

Standards conflict? Who has conflicting floor heating standards?

He shows me his monitoring system. Twelve temperature sensors. Humidity tracking. Automatic shutoff if any zone exceeds limits. It's more sophisticated than some commercial buildings.

'Is this legal?' I ask.

'Is not illegal,' he counters. Technically correct. Building code doesn't explicitly forbid retrofitting ondol in rental apartment because nobody thought anyone would try.

I'm taking photos, making notes, trying to decide if this is brilliant or insane, when the couple from downstairs arrives. The Lewandowskis. They have... opinions."

### Witness #6 & #7: The Lewandowskis, Downstairs Neighbors (Ages 55 and 57)

Maria Lewandowska speaks first: "Our ceiling turned into a foot warmer. You understand? The ceiling! Heat goes up, everyone knows this. But somehow, Korean boy upstairs reversed physics."

Jan Lewandowski adds: "At first, we thought it was nice. November, a bit of warm ceiling, we save on heating. But then it gets warmer. And warmer. By December, we're sleeping with windows open while our ceiling radiates heat like a dying star."

Maria: "We have tropical plants. Had. HAD tropical plants. They think it's summer. Blooming in December! My Christmas cactus is so confused."

Jan: "I'm an electrician. Retired, but still. I know about electrical loads. The boy upstairs is pulling enough power to run small factory. How the building handles it, I don't know."

Maria: "We complained to Mrs. Kowalska. She sends husband. Husband takes one look at our ceiling – you can see the heat patterns, like thermal map – and calls emergency meeting."

Jan: "But here's the thing – we didn't want him evicted. Just... adjusted. Maybe turn it down? Use timer? But Korean boy, he's like man on mission. Shows us research about health benefits. My arthritis, Maria's back pain. Says we're getting free therapy."

Maria: "He's not wrong. My back does feel better. But my ceiling shouldn't be medical device!"

### Witness #8: Dr. Anna Wójcik, General Practitioner (Age 42)

"I run clinic two blocks away. That December, I started seeing pattern – multiple patients from same building, all with similar complaints. Dehydration, heat exhaustion symptoms, but in winter. Very unusual.

Then one patient mentions 'the Korean heater guy.' Another talks about 'tropical ceiling syndrome.' I realize they all live in same building as my yoga instructor, Katarzyna.

I decide to investigate. Medical curiosity, you understand.

I visit Katarzyna, she takes me to neighbor's apartment. The Korean man, Sung-ho, very eager to explain health benefits. Shows me studies – legitimate studies! – about ondol heating and joint health, circulation, sleep quality.

'In Korea,' he says, 'doctors prescribe floor heating for back pain.'

I'm skeptical but intrigued. The heat is intense but not unbearable. The floor heating is actually quite pleasant. I can see why people spend time there.

But then I notice something: everyone in the apartment is slightly flushed. Classic mild hyperthermia. They've adapted, but their bodies are working harder to cool down.

'You need to monitor hydration,' I tell them. 'And maybe lower temperature few degrees?'

Sung-ho looks horrified. 'Lower? This is already compromise temperature. In Korea, would be five degrees warmer!'

That's when I understand – this isn't just about heating preference. It's about fundamental different understanding of comfort, health, home itself.

I leave prescribing water and electrolytes. And secretly wishing my apartment floor was warm too."

### Witness #9: Piotr Kowalczyk, Electrician Called for Emergency (Age 38)

"I get call from building management. 'Emergency,' they say. 'Possible electrical fire.'

I arrive, no smoke, no burning smell. Good signs. Then they explain: tenant installed heating system. Entire floor. By himself. Building's main breaker keeps threatening to trip.

I think: amateur installation, probably dangerous, quick fix. I was wrong.

The Korean guy meets me at door with professional electrical diagram. DIAGRAM! Hand-drawn, to scale, with load calculations. I've seen worse from licensed contractors.

He walks me through installation. Proper gauge wiring. Dedicated circuits. Even installed subpanel to manage loads. It's not up to code – can't be, because code doesn't cover retrofitting Korean floor heating in communist-era building – but it's... thoughtful?

'Power draw is problem?' he asks.

'Building wasn't designed for this load,' I explain.

He nods. Shows me spreadsheet. SPREADSHEET! Calculated building's total capacity, estimated other tenants' usage patterns, determined optimal operating schedule to avoid overload.

'I run heating mainly at night,' he explains. 'When others sleep, less power usage. Very considerate.'

Considerate. He's hacked the building's power grid to be considerate.

I'm examining his work, professionally impressed and personally horrified, when the real chaos starts. Someone called the fire department."

### Witness #10: Captain Stanisław Nowicki, Fire Department (Age 48)

"We arrive for 'electrical fire hazard.' Full crew, ready for action. Find no fire. Find instead... I don't know what to call it. Thermal experiment? Cultural installation? 

Korean tenant very cooperative. Shows us everything. Safety certificates. Temperature monitoring. Emergency shutoffs. He's installed more safety equipment than some commercial kitchens.

My crew is confused. Is it safe? Technically, maybe. Is it legal? No one knows. Building codes didn't anticipate someone importing Korean floor culture to Warsaw.

We're doing inspection when the media arrives. Someone – probably angry neighbor – called TVN24. 'Korean man turns apartment into sauna, threatens building safety.'

Now it's circus. Reporter asking questions. Neighbors gathering. Korean tenant trying to explain ondol culture to increasingly confused crowd.

Then best part – he invites everyone inside. 'Feel the floor!' he says. 'Understand why!'

Half my crew takes off boots to try the warm floor. Reporter doing piece to camera while sitting cross-legged on platform. Building inspector measuring temperatures with laser thermometer and muttering about code amendments.

Never filed stranger report."

### Witness #11: Marta Szymanowska, TVN24 Reporter (Age 31)

"Slow news day. Editor sends me to cover 'apartment building heating dispute.' I'm expecting landlord-tenant drama, maybe faulty radiators. I find... anthropological phenomenon.

Korean tenant, very articulate, explains ondol heating culture. Shows me his apartment – it's like entering different country. The floor is elevated platform, warm to touch, covered in thin mattresses and cushions. No furniture, just low tables.

'In Korea,' he explains, 'life happens on floor. We eat, sleep, work, socialize. Floor must be warm. It's... how you say... civilization foundation?'

I'm taking notes, filming, when neighbors start arriving. Each has different opinion:

- Landlady wants it gone (fire hazard)
- Downstairs neighbors want it adjusted (ceiling too warm)
- Next-door neighbor defends it (helps her back)
- Building inspector can't decide if it's legal
- Doctor explains health implications
- Firefighters testing temperature readings

It's chaos. Beautiful, multicultural chaos.

Best moment: Korean tenant serves everyone tea. Makes them sit on warm floor. One by one, they stop complaining. Start relaxing. Even landlady admits it's 'not unpleasant.'

'You see?' tenant says. 'Warm floor brings people together. Very Korean philosophy.'

My piece runs that evening. Goes viral. 'Korean Man's Warm Floor Divides Warsaw Building.' Thousands of comments. People taking sides: Team Warm Floor vs. Team Building Safety."

### Witness #12: Professor Ewa Jabłońska, Cultural Anthropologist (Age 52)

"I saw the news report. As researcher of cultural adaptation in urban spaces, I had to investigate. This wasn't just heating dispute – it was collision of deeply embedded cultural concepts of home, comfort, and community.

I interview the tenant, Sung-ho. Brilliant young man, engineer, very thoughtful about his cultural needs. He explains ondol isn't just heating – it's lifestyle, health practice, social structure.

'In Korea,' he tells me, 'family gathers on warm floor. No chairs creating hierarchy. Everyone same level. Floor heating brings physical and social warmth.'

I interview Polish neighbors. For them, floor is functional surface, not living space. Heating comes from radiators, period. The idea of sitting, sleeping, eating on floor – even warm floor – challenges fundamental assumptions about domestic space.

The conflict isn't really about temperature or safety. It's about incompatible concepts of home. Sung-ho created Korean domestic space inside Polish architectural framework. Of course there's friction.

But fascinating thing: neighbors who tried the warm floor began understanding. Physical experience bridged cultural gap in way explanations couldn't.

I'm writing paper about it. 'Thermal Borders: When Heating Systems Collide.' Academic gold."

### The Resolution: Multiple Versions

Here's where the story gets complicated. Depending on who you ask, the resolution was different:

**Version A (Mrs. Kowalska, Landlady)**: "I gave him ultimatum: remove the heating or leave. He negotiated. Smart boy. Kept some heating cables but removed platform. Installed proper thermal insulation to protect downstairs neighbors. Still too warm for my taste, but legally acceptable. He pays extra for electricity. Everyone... tolerates."

**Version B (Sung-ho)**: "Victory through compromise. I educated neighbors about ondol benefits. They educated me about Polish building concerns. We found middle way. Lower temperature (painful compromise), better insulation, scheduled heating times. Not perfect, but survivable. Started 'Warm Floor Appreciation Club' – five neighbors now members."

**Version C (Building Inspector Marek)**: "Strangest case of my career. Technically illegal modification, but so well done I recommended building code amendment instead of removal. City council still debating. Meanwhile, installation exists in legal grey zone. I check monthly. Temperature stable, neighbors less complainy. Sometimes bureaucracy needs flexibility."

**Version D (Katarzyna, Next-Door Neighbor)**: "He became local celebrity. 'Warm Floor Guy.' People visit just to experience ondol. My back pain gone. Others report better sleep, less arthritis pain. Building's become oddly close community – we gather in his apartment for Korean movie nights. Who knew warm floors could bring neighbors together?"

**Version E (Dr. Wójcik)**: "Medically fascinating. Several residents report improved joint health, better circulation. Of course, correlation isn't causation, but... interesting. Sung-ho keeps temperature at medically acceptable level now. I've started recommending floor heating to some patients. He gives tours."

### Epilogue: Six Months Later

I visit the building six months after the "Ondol Incident." Things have changed:

- Three more tenants have installed (properly permitted) floor heating
- The building has nickname: "Little Seoul"
- Mrs. Kowalska advertises apartments as "Korean-heating friendly"
- Monthly cultural exchange meetings in Sung-ho's apartment
- Downstairs neighbors growing tropical plants intentionally now

Sung-ho greets me at his door. The apartment is warm but not overwhelming. The platform is gone, replaced by proper insulation and professional heating installation. But the spirit remains – cushions on the floor, low table, life lived horizontally.

"Polish builders helped install properly," he says proudly. "Now meets all codes. Korean comfort, Polish safety."

We sit on the warm floor, drinking tea. Around us, the building hums with its unique thermal ecosystem. It's not Korean, not Polish, but something new. Something Warsaw.

"You know what I learned?" Sung-ho says thoughtfully. "Home isn't just private space. When you change your home, you change neighbors' homes too. In Korea, we know this. In Poland, I had to learn. But now... now we're all learning together."

The warmth seeps up through the floor, through the cushions, into bones that don't know if they're Korean or Polish but know they're comfortable. Outside, Warsaw winter rages. Inside, on this contested, negotiated, hard-won warm floor, there's peace.

Or at least, there's peace until summer, when Sung-ho discovers Polish apartments don't have air conditioning.

But that's another story entirely.

## Version 4: "Thriller paranoiczny" (3900-5400 words)

### Cold War

The floor was trying to kill her.

Aleksandra pressed her back against the wall, feet pulled up onto the couch, staring at the hardwood with pure suspicion. Somewhere beneath that innocent-looking surface, cables hummed with electric heat. Waiting. Plotting.

"It's just floor heating," Jae-sung said for the hundredth time, not looking up from his laptop. "Ondol. Very normal."

Normal. That word had lost all meaning in the three days since she'd moved into his Seoul apartment. Nothing about this was normal. The floor that cooked her feet. The windows sealed shut "to keep the heat in." The thermostat that only went up, never down.

"In Poland," she said carefully, "heat comes from radiators. On walls. Where you can see it. Control it."

He finally looked at her, and something flickered in his eyes. Concern? Or calculation?

"You'll adapt," he said. "Everyone adapts."

But Aleksandra had done her research. Late-night googling had revealed the truth: ondol addiction was real. Koreans who moved abroad suffered withdrawal. They couldn't sleep without heated floors. Some installed illegal systems, risking fires and legal consequences just to feel that warmth again.

What had she gotten herself into?

### Day Four: The Test

"Try it," Jae-sung urged, patting the floor beside him. "Just for five minutes."

The apartment was suffocating. Thirty degrees, according to the thermometer she'd hidden behind the TV. He wore shorts and looked comfortable. She was dying in her lightest clothes, sweat pooling everywhere dignity mattered.

"I have work to do," she lied.

"You can work on the floor. Better for posture." His smile seemed genuine, but she'd learned not to trust smiles. Her ex had smiled while cheating. Her boss smiled while stealing credit. Smiles were weapons.

"I'm fine here."

His face darkened – just for a second. So fast she almost missed it. "You haven't touched the floor since you arrived. Are you afraid of it?"

Yes, her mind screamed. But she forced a laugh. "Don't be ridiculous."

"Then prove it."

A challenge. A test. She recognized the manipulation, but what choice did she have? She'd left everything for this man. Quit her job. Sold her apartment. Burned bridges with family who'd warned her about dating "some Asian guy from the internet."

She slid off the couch. The heat hit immediately – not painful, but invasive. Like stepping into a bath that was just wrong enough to make your skin crawl. She forced herself to sit, legs folded awkwardly.

"See?" Jae-sung moved closer. Too close. "Comfortable, right?"

The heat was seeping into her bones. Making her drowsy. Compliant. She jerked away. "I need water."

In the kitchen, she gulped directly from the tap – another habit he hated. "Use a glass like civilized people," he'd say. But civilization was what had gotten her here, trusting a man who kept his apartment like a crematorium.

Her phone buzzed. Message from her friend Magda: "How's Seoul? How's Prince Charming?"

How could she explain? That Prince Charming lived in a thermal prison? That she was starting to suspect the heat was intentional, designed to weaken her resolve? That she caught him watching her sometimes with an expression she couldn't read?

"Great!" she typed back. "Everything's perfect!"

The lie tasted like ash.

### Day Seven: Paranoid Discoveries

Jae-sung left for work early. Aleksandra waited until she heard the elevator descend, then began her investigation.

The thermostat first. She'd seen him adjust it, fingers flying over buttons in practiced patterns. But when she tried, nothing happened. The temperature display mocked her: 32°C. She pressed every combination. Nothing. As if it was... locked?

Next, the windows. Sealed, he'd said. For efficiency. But the seals looked new. Too new. And was that... she peered closer. Scratches on the frame. Like someone had tried to pry them open. Someone desperate.

Her heart hammered. Who'd lived here before? Why had they left?

The closet held clothes she didn't recognize. Women's clothes. Similar size to hers. Similar style. As if Jae-sung had a type. As if—

"Find something interesting?"

She spun. He stood in the doorway, suit jacket folded over his arm. How had she not heard him return?

"I... was looking for hangers," she stammered.

"Those belong to my ex." His tone was casual. Too casual. "She left suddenly. Never collected them."

"What happened to her?"

"She couldn't adapt." He stepped into the room, and suddenly it felt smaller. "Some people can't handle Korean culture. The heat. The closeness. The... intensity."

Was that a threat? A warning? She couldn't tell anymore. The heat was making her paranoid. Or was the paranoia justified?

"I should donate them," he continued, moving past her to the closet. His arm brushed hers – scorching hot, like he ran warmer than normal humans. "Unless... you want them? You're about her size."

Every instinct screamed danger. But she forced a smile. "That's... thoughtful."

"I'm always thinking of you," he said, and this time she was sure it wasn't romantic. It was something else. Something calculating.

### Day Ten: The Other Girlfriend

Aleksandra discovered the coffee shop by accident. A blessed accident – it had air conditioning cranked to Arctic levels. She'd been sitting there for hours, laptop open, pretending to work while actually savoring the cold.

"You're the new one."

She looked up. A Korean woman stood beside her table, elegant and tired-looking.

"Excuse me?"

"Jae-sung's new girlfriend. The Polish one." The woman sat without invitation. "I'm Min-ji. The ex."

Aleksandra's pulse spiked. "He said you left the country."

"Is that what he said?" Min-ji laughed bitterly. "I left him. There's a difference."

"Why?"

Min-ji studied her for a long moment. "How hot does he keep the apartment?"

The question was so specific, so knowing, that Aleksandra felt ice in her veins despite the café's warmth. "Thirty, thirty-two degrees."

"It'll get worse. Thirty-five by month two. Thirty-eight by month three. He's conditioning you."

"Conditioning me for what?"

"To need it. The heat. Like he does." Min-ji leaned forward. "Ondol addiction is real, but Jae-sung takes it further. He can't stand people who don't love the heat like he does. So he... converts them."

"That's insane."

"Is it? How do you feel when you leave the apartment now?"

Aleksandra didn't answer. But they both knew the truth – the outside world felt cold now. Even in Seoul's summer heat, she found herself shivering. Her body was adapting, just like he'd said.

"He did it to me," Min-ji continued. "To the girl before me. Soon you won't be able to leave. The cold will hurt too much. You'll be dependent on him, on his heat, on his apartment that's slowly cooking you alive."

"You're being dramatic."

"Am I?" Min-ji pulled out her phone, showed her photos. Temperature readings. 40°C. 42°C. 45°C. "This was my last week. I was hallucinating from heat exhaustion, but I couldn't leave because everywhere else felt like a freezer."

Aleksandra stared at the evidence. "How did you escape?"

"Barely. Had to go to a hospital. Took weeks to readjust to normal temperatures. Lost fifteen kilos." She stood. "He picks foreigners because we don't know it's not normal. Korean girlfriends would recognize the manipulation. But we just think it's cultural difference."

She left a business card. "When you're ready to run – and you will be – call me."

### Day Twelve: The Trap Closes

Aleksandra tried to leave that night. Packed quietly while Jae-sung slept, his body radiating heat like a furnace. But at the door, she stopped.

It was July. Seoul summer. Thirty degrees outside.

But she was shivering.

Teeth chattering, she stepped into the hallway. The air conditioning felt like knives. By the time she reached the elevator, she was convulsing. A neighbor found her there, curled in a ball, and called Jae-sung.

He carried her back inside, tender and concerned. "You're sick," he murmured, laying her on the heated floor. "You need rest."

The warmth was heaven. Healing. Essential. She hated herself for relaxing into it, but her body betrayed her. This was what addicts felt, she realized. The need overriding logic.

"Why?" she whispered.

He stroked her hair. "Because I love you. And love means being together. Always. How can we be together if you can't share my world?"

"Your world is too hot."

"No. Your world is too cold. But don't worry. You're adjusting beautifully."

She should have been terrified. Was terrified. But the heat was so soothing, and she was so tired, and fighting seemed pointless when her body craved what he offered.

### Day Fifteen: The Reversal

Min-ji's card burned in her pocket. Aleksandra had hidden it, but hadn't called. Couldn't call. The thought of leaving the warm apartment made her physically ill.

But she had to try. For her sanity. For her life.

She waited until Jae-sung was showering – the one time he couldn't monitor her. Grabbed her phone with shaking hands. Dialed.

"Finally," Min-ji answered immediately. "Where are you?"

"Still here. I can't... the cold..."

"I know. Listen carefully. There's a therapy center. They help people break thermal dependencies. I'll send the address. Can you get there?"

"I'll try."

"Don't try. Do. He's escalating faster with you than he did with us."

Us. How many had there been?

The shower stopped. Aleksandra hung up, deleted the call history. When Jae-sung emerged, she was lying on the floor, exactly where he'd left her.

"Feeling better?" he asked.

"Yes," she lied.

But something in his eyes said he knew.

### Day Sixteen: The Truth

She found the journal by accident. Hidden behind Korean books she couldn't read. But this was in English, written in Jae-sung's neat hand.

Names. Dates. Temperature logs.

*Sarah (UK): 58 days to full thermal dependence. Left at day 62. Failed.*

*Yuki (Japan): 45 days to full thermal dependence. Stayed 186 days. Partial success.*

*Elena (Russia): 72 days to full thermal dependence. Hospitalized day 74. Failed.*

*Aleksandra (Poland): Day 16. Progressing faster than expected. Increase to 35°C tomorrow.*

There were more. So many more. A catalog of women from cold countries, lured by love, trapped by heat. Some entries had notes: "Natural resistance to heat. Increase gradually." Or "Attempted escape day 30. Prevented. Increased emotional manipulation."

She was just another experiment. Another attempt to create the perfect heat-dependent partner.

The apartment door opened. No time to hide the journal. She clutched it, facing him as he entered.

His eyes went to the book. No surprise. Just... disappointment.

"You weren't supposed to find that yet," he said calmly.

"Yet?"

"I was going to show you. When you were ready. When you understood." He moved closer, and she backed away. "It's not what you think."

"You're conditioning women to need your heat. Trapping them."

"I'm finding someone who can share my life!" For the first time, real emotion cracked his facade. "Do you know what it's like? To need something everyone else considers excessive? To be unable to sleep without the floor warming your bones? To freeze in normal temperatures?"

"That's not love. It's imprisonment."

"Is it?" He gestured around the apartment. "You're free to leave. The door's right there."

They both knew she couldn't. Not anymore. The conditioning had worked too well.

"The others left," she said. "I could too."

"Some left," he corrected. "Others... adapted differently."

A chill ran through her despite the heat. "What does that mean?"

"Min-ji told you she escaped. Did she mention she texts me? Begs to come back? That she installed ondol in her new apartment, but it's not the same?" His smile was sad and terrible. "They all come back, eventually. Or try to. Because once you've lived like this, everything else feels like dying."

"You're sick."

"I'm evolved. And soon, you will be too."

### Day Seventeen: The Twist

Aleksandra's escape plan was simple: gradual exposure. Every time Jae-sung left, she'd turn down the thermostat one degree. Stand by the sealed windows where tiny drafts leaked through. Build tolerance.

It was agony. But less agony than staying.

She was at 28°C when she heard the key in the lock. Too early – he never came home for lunch. Panicking, she tried to reset the thermostat, but her fingers fumbled.

He walked in just as the display flickered back to 32°C.

"Clever," he said. No anger. Almost... proud? "How long have you been doing this?"

No point lying. "Three days."

"And how do you feel?"

Like death. Like ice was growing in her veins. But she lifted her chin. "Fine."

"Good. Then you're ready for the truth." He sat on the floor, patting the spot beside him. When she didn't move, he sighed. "I'm not the villain you think I am."

"The journal says otherwise."

"The journal is documentation. Science. Not evil." He pulled out his phone, showed her an app. Temperature readings from around the world. "Do you know why I chose you? All of you?"

She stayed silent.

"Because you're from cold countries. Strong stock. Evolved for harsh conditions. The perfect candidates for the program."

"What program?"

"Climate change is accelerating. Temperatures rising. Soon, large parts of the Earth will be uninhabitable for normal humans. But not for us. Not for people adapted to extreme heat."

She laughed. Couldn't help it. "You're saying this is... evolutionary preparation?"

"I'm saying humanity needs to adapt or die. And adaptation can be guided. Controlled." He gestured to the apartment. "This is a laboratory. And we're the experiment."

"You're insane."

"Am I? You've survived temperatures that would hospitalize most people. Your body has changed at the cellular level. You're becoming something new."

"Something dependent on you."

"No. Something dependent on heat. I'm just the delivery system." He stood, walked to the window. Made a show of entering a code. The seals released with a soft hiss. "You want to leave? Leave. But know this – you're not escaping prison. You're abandoning evolution."

The open window called to her. Freedom. Cold, painful freedom.

She stood on shaking legs. Moved toward it. The closer she got, the colder the air felt. By the time she reached the sill, she was shivering so hard she could barely stand.

"It's July," Jae-sung said softly. "Thirty-two degrees outside. And you're freezing. What will winter be like? Where will you go? Who will understand what you need now?"

She gripped the window frame. Freedom was right there. One step.

"The others who left," he continued, "they all struggled. Jobs were impossible – office air conditioning was torture. Relationships failed – no one understood why they needed tropical temperatures. They became isolated. Desperate. And eventually..."

"They came back."

"Or found others like them. There's a whole community now. My success stories. Living in the hot zones. Thriving where others merely survive."

She turned to face him. "And if I stay?"

"Then we continue your transformation. Together. Partners in evolution." He smiled, and for the first time, it seemed genuine. "I do care for you, Aleksandra. That's why I chose you. You're strong enough for this."

The window remained open. The choice was hers.

But was it really a choice when her body had already decided?

### The Final Reversal

Aleksandra's hand was on the window frame when her phone buzzed. Min-ji again.

"Don't answer that," Jae-sung said sharply.

But she did. "Hello?"

"Check the news. Now. Channel 9."

She grabbed the remote, ignoring Jae-sung's protests. The news flashed on. A breaking story. Police raids. Apartments full of heating equipment. Women hospitalized.

"...underground network targeting foreign women... thermal conditioning... several arrests..."

The screen showed a familiar face being led away in handcuffs. Not Jae-sung. Someone else. Another Korean man. Another apartment. Another victim.

"It's not just you," she breathed.

Jae-sung had gone very still. "Aleksandra..."

"It's a network. You're all doing this. How many women? How many apartments?"

He moved toward her, but she backed away, toward the open window. The cold hit like a wall, but she forced herself to stand in it.

"It's not what the news says," he started.

"Evolution? Climate change? Or just sick men who get off on controlling women?"

"You don't understand—"

"I understand perfectly." The cold was agony, but it was also clarity. "You prey on lonely women. Foreigners. Isolated. Vulnerable. You make us dependent, then call it love."

Sirens wailed outside. Getting closer.

Jae-sung's face had gone pale. "They don't have evidence. You've been here voluntarily. No locks. No force."

"Just psychological manipulation. Thermal torture. Documented in your own handwriting." She held up his journal. When had she grabbed it? The cold was making her bold. Or desperate.

"You won't testify. You can't." He gestured to her shivering form. "Look at yourself. You need this. Need me."

More sirens. Footsteps in the hallway.

"Maybe," she admitted. "But I need justice more."

The pounding on the door was thunderous. Police. Min-ji had done more than warn her – she'd gathered the victims. Built a case.

Jae-sung looked between her and the door, calculating. Then he smiled. That same sad, terrible smile.

"You'll be back," he said. "When winter comes. When the cold becomes unbearable. I'll be waiting."

The door burst open. Police flooded in. Aleksandra stood in the window's cold draft, shaking but victorious.

But as they led Jae-sung away, she wondered if he was right. Already, the air conditioning in the police station felt arctic. The thought of Polish winter made her nauseated.

Min-ji met her at the hospital. "The conditioning can be reversed. It takes time, but you'll be normal again."

Normal. That word had lost all meaning.

"How many others?" Aleksandra asked.

"Dozens. Maybe hundreds. They're still finding apartments."

"And the men?"

"Some arrested. Others fled. But we stopped them. You stopped them."

Had she? Or had she just traded one prison for another – the prison of always being cold, always craving warmth she could never safely have?

Time would tell.

But as she sat in the hospital bed, every cell screaming for heat, she knew one thing: she'd rather freeze free than burn in captivity.

Even if freezing felt like dying.

### March 15: First Contact

Dear Diary (no, that's stupid. Let's try again.)

Temperature Log, Day 1 (too clinical)

Fuck it. I'm just going to write.

So I met someone. On a dating app, because apparently that's how humans connect now. His name is Dong-hyun, he's Korean, works in IT, and his profile said he "likes cozy nights in." I thought that meant Netflix and wine. I'm an idiot.

Our first date was coffee. Normal. Nice. He wore a puffer jacket even though it was 15°C. I thought he was just being dramatic.

"I'm always cold in Poland," he said, wrapping his hands around his latte like it was the last heat source on Earth.

"It's literally spring," I laughed.

He gave me this look. This "you sweet summer child" look. I should have known.

But he was cute, and funny, and when he talked about missing Korean food, his whole face lit up. So when he invited me to his place for dinner, I said yes.

I'm writing this now, at 2 AM, because I can't sleep. My feet are ice. My apartment feels like a morgue. What has he done to me?

### March 22: The Dinner

Okay, I need to document this properly because my friends think I'm exaggerating.

Arrived at Dong-hyun's apartment at 7 PM. The moment he opened the door, I was hit by a wall of heat. Like, physical wall. Like opening an oven.

"Come in, come in!" He was barefoot, wearing shorts and a t-shirt. In MARCH.

I stepped inside. The floor was... warm? No, not warm. HOT. Through my socks.

"Shoes off, please," he said.

I took them off. Put my feet on the floor. Jumped back.

"IS YOUR FLOOR ON FIRE?"

He laughed. Actually laughed. "It's ondol. Korean floor heating. I installed special mats."

Special mats. The entire floor of his apartment was covered in electric heating mats, cranked to what felt like surface-of-the-sun temperature.

"This is... normal?" I asked, hopping from foot to foot.

"In Korea, yes. Here, I improvise." He handed me slippers. "These help until you get used to it."

Get used to it. Like this was something humans could get used to.

But the dinner was amazing. He'd made kimchi jjigae and bulgogi, and we sat on cushions on the BURNING FLOOR eating with chopsticks while he told me about growing up in Busan. His eyes got soft when he talked about winter nights with his family, everyone gathered on the warm floor.

"In Korea, heat is love," he said. "My grandmother used to say, 'If the floor is cold, the heart is cold.'"

By the end of the night, I'd taken off my sweater. And my socks. The floor didn't feel quite so hot anymore. Or maybe I was dying. Hard to tell.

When I left, the outside air hit me like an arctic blast. It was 12°C. TWELVE. I shivered all the way home.

What is happening to me?

### March 29: The Text Exchange

[Screenshot of messages]

Dong-hyun: How are you feeling?

Me: Cold

Dong-hyun: ㅋㅋㅋㅋ want to come over? I made pajeon

Me: Is your floor still lava?

Dong-hyun: It's only 28 degrees

Me: ONLY???

Dong-hyun: I turned it down for you ❤️

Me: ...I'll bring wine

[End screenshot]

I'm going back. God help me, I'm going back to the thermal death trap. Because apparently, I like him more than I like normal body temperature.

Mom, if you find this diary after I've been cooked alive, know that he was worth it.

### April 3: Meeting the Friends

Dong-hyun invited me to Korean game night at his friend's place. I wore layers. So many layers.

Walked in to find six Koreans sitting on the floor around a low table, all in t-shirts, apartment heated to approximately the temperature of Mercury.

"This is Katja," Dong-hyun introduced me. "She's still adjusting to proper heating."

They all looked at me with sympathy. SYMPATHY. Like I was the broken one.

His friend Min-woo said, "My Canadian girlfriend took three months to adapt. Now she complains when it's below 25."

"That's Stockholm syndrome," I said.

They laughed. They thought I was joking.

We played hwatu (Korean cards) and drank soju. By the end of the night, I'd shed three layers and was lying on the floor like everyone else. The heat had seeped into my bones. When someone opened a window for "fresh air," I actually whined.

"She's converting," someone said in Korean. (I'm learning. Slowly.)

"I am NOT," I protested.

But later, walking home with Dong-hyun, I pressed closer to him than necessary. He radiated heat like a personal furnace.

"Your apartment's going to feel cold," he predicted.

He was right. I slept in wool socks and a hoodie. In April.

### April 15: The Confession

We were at my place for once. I'd cranked the heating to 23°C (my heating bill is going to be insane). He still wore a sweater.

"I have a confession," I said, after my second glass of wine. "I Googled 'ondol addiction.'"

He raised an eyebrow.

"It's a real thing! Koreans who move abroad can't sleep without heated floors. They get desperate. Install dangerous heating systems. Risk fires."

"And?" He was trying not to smile.

"And I think you're trying to convert me. Like a thermal vampire. Soon I'll need heated floors to survive."

He set down his wine. Looked at me seriously. "Katja, if you're uncomfortable—"

"No! I mean... no. It's just... I used to be normal. I used to wear t-shirts in 18-degree weather. Now I'm cold all the time. Except at your place. Your hellfire apartment is the only place I'm warm."

He was quiet for a moment. Then: "Do you know why I really keep it so hot?"

I shook my head.

"First winter in Poland, I got so cold I couldn't think. Couldn't work. Couldn't sleep. I was miserable. I thought about going home every day." He pulled his sweater sleeves down. "Then I discovered electric mats. Saved enough to buy one. Then another. And another. Until my floor was Korea again."

"That's..."

"Pathetic?"

"I was going to say dedicated."

He laughed. "My ex said obsessive. She's probably right. But Katja... I'm not trying to convert you. If you hate the heat, we can meet other places. I just... I can't change this about myself. The cold hurts. Not just uncomfortable. Hurts."

Looking at him, bundled in my apartment that I'd heated to tropical levels (for Poland), I realized something. We were both adapting. Him to my cold, me to his heat. Meeting in the middle, even if the middle was slightly hellish.

"Teach me," I said.


"What?"

"Teach me to love the heat. Show me the Korean way. If we're doing this, I want to understand."

His smile could have powered his floor heating for a week.

### April 20: Ondol Bootcamp

Dong-hyun took my thermal education seriously. Too seriously.

Day 1: Temperature acclimatization. Started at 25°C, raised one degree every hour. I lasted until 29°C before tapping out.

Day 2: Floor sitting practice. Learned proper posture. Discovered muscles I didn't know existed.

Day 3: Traditional Korean meal on the floor. Spilled soup. Burned my ankle. Questioned life choices.

Day 4: Introduced to jjimjilbang videos. "When we visit Korea," he said, "you need to be ready for REAL heat." Saunas at 90°C. I laughed. He didn't.

Day 5: Sleeping on the floor test. Thin mat on heated floor. Woke up at 3 AM feeling like a rotisserie chicken. He was peacefully snoring.

"You're improving!" he said the next morning, finding me in the bathroom with my face pressed against the cold tiles.

"I'm dying."

"You're adapting."

"Those are the same thing."

But here's the stupid part: I was starting to like it. The floor heat, not the dying. There was something weirdly comforting about the warmth seeping up from below. Like being hugged by the Earth.

I didn't tell him that. He was already too smug.

### May 1: The Revelation

Found an old text from my ex: "Why is your apartment so fucking cold? It's like dating a penguin."

I'd forgotten. I used to be the cold one. 18°C max, windows cracked even in winter. Exes complained constantly. I thought they were weak.

Now I'm sitting in 26°C wearing fuzzy socks, and it feels normal.

Called Mom.

"I'm worried I'm losing myself," I said.

"To what?"

"Korean floor heating."

Long pause. "Katja, are you on drugs?"

"I'm dating a Korean guy who keeps his apartment at 30 degrees and I think I'm starting to like it and what if I can never live normally again?"

"Honey," Mom said slowly, "you're calling me about TEMPERATURE? Not about commitment or culture clash or language barriers, but TEMPERATURE?"

"It's a metaphor for everything else!"

"Is it though?"

Damn. Mom wisdom strikes again.

### May 15: The Parents Visit

Dong-hyun's parents visited from Korea. I was nervous about meeting them, but not for normal reasons. I was nervous about their thermal expectations.

"They'll think your apartment is refrigerator," Dong-hyun warned.

"It's 27 degrees!"

"Exactly."

His mother walked in wearing a parka. In May. His father immediately sat on the floor and nodded approvingly at the heating mats.

"좋아, 좋아," he said. Good, good.

His mother felt the floor temperature with her palm like she was taking its pulse. Then felt MY palm. Shook her head.

"Too cold," she told Dong-hyun in Korean. "She needs more iron. And warmer floors."

She'd brought gifts: thermal underwear, heated insoles, and a portable heating pad. "For when you visit cold places," she said kindly.

Cold places. Like, you know, the rest of the world.

But they were lovely. His mom taught me to make kimchi while sitting on the warm floor. His dad fixed the one heating mat that had been flickering. They told embarrassing stories about baby Dong-hyun refusing to wear shoes because he loved the ondol too much.

"He's like his grandmother," his mother said. "She kept the ondol burning even in summer. Said cold floors steal your life force."

When they left, she hugged me. "You good girl," she said in English. "You understand warm. You understand Dong-hyun."

I almost cried. Being accepted by Korean parents felt like passing a test I didn't know I was taking.

### June 1: Summer Complications

Plot twist: Polish summer arrived. Suddenly it's 25°C outside and normal humans are wearing shorts.

Dong-hyun and I are having our first real fight.

"We can turn the floor heating down," I suggested, sweating in his now-sauna-like apartment.

"It IS down. Only 26 degrees."

"It's 28 outside! Your apartment is cooler than outside and still too hot!"

"Then we use air conditioning."

"While the floor heating is on? That's insane!"

"It's balanced!"

We stared at each other across the thermal divide. For the first time, I wondered if this would work. Can love survive such fundamental disagreements about basic comfort?

"In Korea," he said quietly, "we have ondol even in summer. Just... less."

"This isn't Korea."

"No," he agreed. "But I'm still Korean."

We compromised: Floor heating only in the bedroom, AC in the living room. It's ridiculous. Our electricity bill could fund a small country. But we're making it work.

### June 15: The Test

Went to a friend's party. Normal Polish apartment. Normal temperature (22°C). Sat on normal, unheated floor for party games.

Within an hour, my back hurt. My joints ached. I kept shifting, trying to get comfortable.

"You okay?" my friend Anna asked.

"The floor is cold."

"It's... a floor?"

How to explain that I'd been spoiled by Korean floor heating? That my body now expected warmth from below? That I was seriously considering buying a portable heating pad to carry to social events?

I lasted two hours before texting Dong-hyun.

Me: Your apartment has ruined me for normal life

Dong-hyun: My apartment? Or me? 😏

Me: Both. Pick me up?

Dong-hyun: Already outside

I found him in his car, heated seats on, smile knowing.

"I brought you something," he said, handing me a package.

Portable heating pad. Battery-powered.

"For emergencies," he explained.

I should have been insulted. Instead, I nearly cried with gratitude. This is what my life has become.

### July 1: The Ultimatum

My lease is up for renewal. Landlord wants to know if I'm staying.

Dong-hyun, casually: "You could move in with me."

Me, less casually: "Into your thermal death trap?"

"I could install better cooling. Or we could get a new place. With proper ondol."

"Proper ondol. In Warsaw."

"Why not?"

Why not, indeed. Except for the installation costs, the building permits, the confused Polish contractors, the probably illegal electrical work...

"Or," he continued, "we could get a place with good insulation and portable mats. Compromise."

That word again. Our whole relationship is built on thermal compromise.

"I need to think," I said.

But I already knew. The thought of going back to cold floors, cold apartment, cold life... when had warm become home?

### July 10: The Evidence

Found a video on my phone from last week. I'm lying on Dong-hyun's floor, laptop balanced on my stomach, working. Completely casual. Like the floor isn't 28 degrees. Like this is normal behavior.

Showed it to my Polish friends. They were horrified.

"You've been brainwashed," Magda said.

"It's comfortable!" I protested.

"It's weird."

But that night, in my own apartment with its reasonable temperature and cold floors, I missed it. Missed the warmth. Missed him. Missed the weird Korean floor culture I'd somehow become part of.

Is this growth or have I just gone native?

### July 20: The Decision

We're apartment hunting. Together. The requirements list is insane:

- Good insulation
- Floor suitable for heating installation  
- Understanding landlord
- South-facing windows (for natural warmth)
- Energy-efficient electrical system
- Neighbors who won't complain about ceiling warmth

"We're never going to find this," I said after the fifth viewing.

"We will," Dong-hyun insisted. "Seoul is expensive too. Patience."

"In Seoul, apartments come with ondol."

"In Seoul, you'd die of summer humidity."

Fair point.

But we keep looking. Because apparently, I've decided. Somewhere between March's "your floor is lava" and July's "I need heated floors to function," I chose this. Chose him. Chose us.

Even if "us" means a lifetime of thermal negotiations.

### August 1: New Chapter

We found it. A ground-floor apartment with in-floor heating. ACTUAL IN-FLOOR HEATING. Not ondol, exactly, but water pipes that create similar effect.

The landlord, Pan Wojciech, is an engineer who lived in Japan for ten years.

"I understand," he said when we explained our needs. "My wife is Japanese. We had same problem. This system works for both cultures."

Dong-hyun nearly cried. I did cry.

Moving in together feels huge. But what feels bigger is that we found a solution. A real, sustainable, won't-burn-the-building-down solution.

"You know what this means?" Dong-hyun said as we signed the lease.

"What?"

"No more thermal warfare. Just thermal peace."

"Thermal détente," I corrected.

"I'll take it."

### August 15: The Final Entry

First night in the new place. The floor is warm - not Korean hot, not Polish cold, but something in between. We're lying on it (of course), surrounded by boxes, eating takeout directly from containers.

"I have a confession," Dong-hyun says.

"Another one?"

"I turned my apartment extra hot the first time you came over. To test you."

"WHAT?"

"Only by a few degrees! I wanted to see if you could handle Korean-level warmth. If you couldn't..." He shrugged.

"You thermal-tested me?"

"You passed."

"I barely survived!"

"But you came back. That's what mattered."

I should be mad. I'm sort of mad. But also... I get it. We all have our deal-breakers. His just happened to be temperature-related.

"I have a confession too," I said. "I've been setting your contact photo as fire emojis in my phone."

"That's not a confession. That's just accurate."

We laughed. Kissed. Made plans to christen every warm spot of floor in the apartment (for cultural reasons, obviously).

Looking back at these entries, I can see the journey. From shock to adaptation to acceptance to... love? Not just of him, but of this weird cultural quirk that's become part of my life.

I'm a Polish girl who needs heated floors now. My ancestors are probably rolling in their cold graves. But I'm warm, and happy, and home.

Even if home is several degrees hotter than nature intended.

*P.S. - Just checked the thermostat. 24.5°C. We've set it exactly between Korean comfort (27°C) and Polish normal (22°C). If that's not love, I don't know what is.*

*[This version uses diary entries to track the protagonist's gradual transformation from temperature shock to acceptance, revealing deeper truths about adaptation, compromise, and love through the intimate, chronological format.]*
