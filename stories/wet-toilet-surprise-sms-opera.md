# Wet Toilet Surprise
## SMS-owa opera mydlana (SMS Opera)
*As told by Jadzia Kim*

**A Note from Jadzia Kim:**

What you're about to read shouldn't exist. These messages were never meant to be public. I received them from an anonymous source who claimed to work for a major telecom company in Warsaw. They arrived in my inbox with the subject line: "당신은 이것을 봐야합니다" (You need to see this).

I've spent weeks verifying their authenticity. The timestamps match. The phone numbers (now redacted) check out. The autocorrect disasters are too perfectly imperfect to be fake.

This is a love story told in texts, typos, and tears. It's about Mina Jeong, a Korean product designer who moved to Warsaw for work, and Tomek Kowalski, her Polish neighbor who installed a bidet that changed everything.

I've organized the chats chronologically, preserving all the original messages—including the ones they tried to delete. Because in our digital age, nothing truly disappears.

The story begins, as many modern romances do, with a maintenance request...

## Epilogue: Jadzia Kim's Final Notes

I received one last message from my anonymous source yesterday. It was a photo from Mina and Tomek's wedding this past summer. In the background, you can see a custom wedding cake shaped like... yes, a bidet. Because of course.

They still live in Building 7. Tomek has expanded his plumbing business to specialize in "International Bathroom Solutions." Mina works remotely for the Seoul office, designing products that bridge cultures.

And yes, they still text each other constantly. Even when they're in the same room.

Some love stories begin with eyes meeting across a crowded room. Others start with a simple "hello." But sometimes, just sometimes, love begins with a leaking sink, a helpful neighbor, and a bidet that changed everything.

In our hyper-connected world, we often worry that technology is making us more distant. But Mina and Tomek's story reminds us that connection isn't about the medium—it's about the message. It's about finding someone who'll install a bidet for you, who'll wait through 8,000 kilometers of distance, who'll learn your language one voice message at a time.

Their texts are now private again, as they should be. But their story—told in typos and emojis, in autocorrect fails and 3am messages—proves that love finds a way. Even if that way involves multiple bathroom floods and bunny pajamas.

사랑은 길을 찾는다. Miłość znajdzie drogę.  
Love finds a way.

*—Jadzia Kim*  
*Seoul/Warsaw, 2025*

[THE END]
