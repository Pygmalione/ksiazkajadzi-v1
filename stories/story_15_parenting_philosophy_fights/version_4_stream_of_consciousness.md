# Story 15: Parenting Philosophy Fights - Education approaches
## Version 4: "Strumień świadomości matki" (Stream of consciousness of a mother)

3:47 AM and I'm googling "is it child abuse to make 6 year old do multiplication tables" while Ji-hoon snores beside me dreaming probably of Excel spreadsheets filled with our daughter's future SAT scores and I can't breathe can't breathe because tomorrow is Saturday which means Korean school which means Maja will cry again will beg to go to the playground instead and I'll have to be the bad cop again the cultural translator the bridge the betrayer of my Polish half that still remembers climbing trees until dark and my Korean half that knows knows KNOWS she'll thank us later won't she? 

Won't she?

Jin-soo's mother called yesterday. "How are Maja's scores?" Scores. SCORES. She's six. What scores? The score of how many dandelions she collected? The score of her laugh decibels? But no, she means the Kumon progress, the reading level, the mathematical advancement that I track in a secret notebook like some educational spy because if I don't have data Jin-soo panics and if Jin-soo panics he makes spreadsheets and if he makes spreadsheets I want to throw my laptop in the Vistula.

But also.

Also I remember. Seoul. 1997. The IMF crisis. My father's business collapsed overnight. OVERNIGHT. And the only kids who survived, whose families didn't dissolve into poverty and shame, were the ones with perfect scores. Education was armor. Is armor. Will be armor?

Maja drew a picture yesterday. "This is Mommy when I do Korean homework" - angry face, steam coming from ears. "This is Mommy when we make pierogi" - hearts for eyes, smile like the sun. When did I become two mothers? When did she learn to see the split?

Her Polish teacher says she's anxious. Anxious. At six. Asks permission to color outside lines. Double-checks her answers even in art. "There are no wrong answers in art," Mrs. Kowalska says, looking at me like I'm some kind of Asian tiger mother stereotype but she doesn't understand doesn't understand that in my bones I carry my grandmother who couldn't read because girls didn't need education until war took everything and then education was all she preached all she believed all she beat into my mother who beat it into me not with hands but with expectations heavy as han itself.

Jin-soo made a PowerPoint. Of course he did. "Maja's Academic Trajectory 2024-2042." Slide 23 shows projected income differentials based on university rankings. I wanted to laugh. I wanted to cry. I poured wine instead.

"She could be anything," he says. Doctor lawyer engineer CEO professor and I think but what if she wants to be happy? But that's my Polish side talking the side that spent summers at babcia's house making flower crowns and eating wild berries and nobody asked about my math scores nobody cared if I was ADVANCING.

Advancing toward what?

4:15 AM now. I check on Maja. She's sleeping with her Korean workbook under her pillow "for good dreams about numbers" she said. Jin-soo taught her that. Also sleeping: her Polish storybook about the dragon who preferred painting to fighting. I taught her that. She clutches both. My heart breaks into exactly two pieces labeled "too much" and "not enough."

The other Korean mothers judge me. I see it in their eyes at Saturday school pickup. My daughter's Korean is imperfect. She plays during break instead of reviewing. She asks "why" too often - Polish children question, Korean children accept, where does that leave her? Somewhere in the middle. Nowhere.

The Polish mothers judge me too. Why Saturday school? Why homework at her age? Why can't I just let her be a child? But they don't understand that in Korea "being a child" includes studying. Joy and discipline aren't opposites they're... they're... I don't know what they are anymore.

Jin-soo's spreadsheet has a column for "unstructured play." He schedules spontaneity. "Tuesday 4-5 PM: Free exploration time." I want to scream THIS ISN'T HOW FREEDOM WORKS but also I'm grateful because without the schedule he'd fill every minute with educational activities and at least this way she gets that hour. 

That one hour.

Remember when we met? Warsaw University library. He was studying Polish corporate law I was researching Korean literature and he asked to borrow my pencil. In Korean. I answered in Polish. We laughed. Everything seemed possible then. Love would conquer cultural differences. We were educated modern global citizens what could go wrong?

Everything. Nothing. Both.

Maja loves math now. Actually loves it. Does problems for fun. Jin-soo glows with pride and I feel... what? Happy? Sad? Both? She's six and solving problems I couldn't do at ten but she also asked yesterday if it's okay to be bad at something. "What if I try my best but still fail?" Where does a six-year-old learn to fear failure? 

From us. From me. From the space between cultures where nothing is ever enough.

5:42 AM. Almost morning. Today's schedule:
- 7 AM Korean mathematics
- 8 AM Breakfast with flashcards
- 9 AM Korean school 
- 1 PM Polish family lunch (the resistance, the rebellion, the breath)
- 3 PM "Free play" (scheduled spontaneity)
- 5 PM Reading time (Korean Korean Korean why is her Polish reading falling behind?)
- 7 PM Family time (Jin-soo will sneak in educational games)
- 8 PM Bed (she'll lie awake worrying about tomorrow's Korean test)

But also:
- Sometime: She'll laugh
- Somewhere: She'll discover something wonderful
- Somehow: She'll navigate this bicultural maze better than we do

The Polish mother in me whispers: "Let her sleep in. Cancel Korean school. Make pancakes in pajamas. Childhood is short."

The Korean mother in me screams: "Every minute counts. Every lesson matters. The world is competitive. Prepare her."

The real me, Jadzia Kim, stuck between Warsaw and Seoul, between pierogi and kimchi, between freedom and discipline? I pour coffee. Strong. Black. No culture claims coffee. Coffee is neutral territory.

Maja appears in the doorway. Pajamas. Bedhead. "Mama, I had a dream in Korean but the ending was in Polish." 

Of course she did.

"Was it a good dream?"

"The best. I was solving math problems but the numbers were dancing."

Dancing numbers. Korean structure, Polish joy. Maybe she's already figured out what Jin-soo and I are still fighting about. Maybe the next generation doesn't choose between cultures but creates something new.

"Mama, why are you crying?"

"I'm not crying, kochanie. Just tired."

"Is it because of the education war again?"

Education war. She calls our conflicts "the education war." When did she learn this phrase? What child should know such words?

Jin-soo appears. Sees my tears. Doesn't ask. Makes tea instead. Korean barley tea. In Polish pottery mugs. We sit. Silent. Watching our daughter color. Inside the lines. Outside the lines. Creating her own lines.

"Maybe," he says quietly, "we're doing okay."

"Maybe," I agree.

But maybe isn't enough when you're raising a child between worlds. Or maybe maybe is all we have. Maybe is the space where Korean meets Polish. Where structure dances with freedom. Where our daughter lives, thrives, suffers, soars.

6:30 AM. Time to wake her. Time to start the schedule. Time to fight the war. Time to build the bridge. Time to be two mothers in one body. Time to trust that somehow, in the push and pull, in the tears and triumphs, in the math problems and mud pies, we're creating something new.

Something Korean-Polish.
Something impossible.
Something beautiful.
Something ours.

Maja stirs. Opens her eyes. "Is it Korean Saturday or Polish Saturday?"

"Both," I tell her. "Always both."

She nods like this makes perfect sense. 

Maybe it does.

Maybe that's the answer we've been fighting to find. Not either/or but always both. Always everything. Always too much and never enough and exactly right all at once.

The education war continues. But this morning, in the space between Korean ambition and Polish freedom, our daughter draws dragons solving calculus while wearing flower crowns, and somehow that's exactly what the world needs.

Another bicultural warrior. 
Another bridge.
Another hope.

Now if you'll excuse me, I need to hide the Kumon worksheets before babcia arrives and discovers we've been teaching algebra to a kindergartener. Some battles are too big even for the space between cultures.

But we fight them anyway.
Because that's what parents do.
In any language.
In every culture.
Forever and always.

Even at 3:47 AM when the world splits into two and you're standing in the crack trying to hold it together with nothing but love and coffee and the desperate hope that somehow your child will thank you instead of therapy bills when she's thirty.

Maja, if you read this someday: I'm sorry. And you're welcome. And I love you in Korean and Polish and in the wordless language of mothers who do their best with the cultures they carry and the futures they can't predict.

Now let's start your Korean math.
But first, let's dance.
