# Story 15: Parenting Philosophy Fights - Education approaches
## Version 5: "Perspective dziecka, realizm magiczny" (Child's perspective, magical realism)

My name is Soo-jin but also Zuzia and I am seven years old but sometimes I feel like I'm fourteen because that's how old you have to be in Korean years when you're seven in Polish years, which makes bedtime very confusing.

I live in the space between Mama's soft Polish words and Appa's sharp Korean sounds, in an apartment where the air changes flavor depending on which parent is home. When Mama breathes, the air tastes like forest mushrooms and Sunday afternoons. When Appa breathes, it tastes like pencil shavings and the future.

### The Two Clocks

We have two clocks in our house. The Polish clock runs slow and lazy, its hands dragging through honey-time where minutes stretch like taffy and there's always time for one more story. The Korean clock runs fast-fast-fast, tick-tick-ticking toward tomorrow, always tomorrow, never today.

I tried to synchronize them once. The clocks screamed so loud only I could hear them. Now I live in the twelve-minute gap between them, the only place where both my parents make sense.

### The Homework Dragon

Every day at 4 PM, the Homework Dragon arrives. He's invisible to grown-ups but I see him clearly - scales made of graph paper, breath that smells like erasers, eyes that glow like calculator screens.

"Time for mathematics," he hisses in Appa's voice.

I want to run but my feet grow Korean roots, planted firm and obedient. The dragon opens his mouth and worksheet papers flutter out like white butterflies that died mid-flight.

"Just one hour," the dragon promises, but his hours are Korean hours. They multiply when you're not looking. One becomes two becomes three becomes dinner gets cold and Mama's smile gets tight.

Some days I feed the dragon correct answers and he purrs like a photocopier. Other days I make mistakes and he grows bigger, bigger, until he fills the whole apartment and Mama has to come chase him away with Polish lullabies.

### The Playground That Exists on Tuesdays

There's a playground that only exists when Mama takes me there. It's not on any map - Korean GPS can't find it because it doesn't lead anywhere productive. 

In this playground, swings pump you full of Polish sky. The sandbox contains actual sand from the Baltic Sea that whispers stories about amber and mermaids. The slide leads to different universes where children's laughter is considered a university degree.

But the playground vanishes when Appa calls. His voice travels through cell towers and turns the swings into desk chairs, the sandbox into a giant workbook. I become gravity-heavy with responsibility.

"Where were you?" he asks when we get home.

"At the playground," I say.

"For two hours?"

I don't tell him that Polish hours are different. That in Polish hours, we built entire civilizations out of sticks and leaves. That we solved the mystery of why clouds float. That these are also mathematics, just not the kind that fits on worksheets.

### The Weekend War

Saturdays smell like conflict. I wake up and the apartment is already choosing sides. The Korean side marshals its forces: textbooks standing at attention, pencils sharpened for battle, the computer humming with educational purpose. The Polish side practices guerrilla resistance: storybooks hidden under pillows, art supplies "accidentally" left on the desk, the window open to let in possibility.

"Korean school," says Appa.

"But it's Saturday," says Mama.

They don't fight with voices anymore. They fight with looks that carry the weight of their grandmothers' expectations. I am the territory they're fighting over, the border where their love crashes into itself.

I've learned to split myself in half. Korean Soo-jin goes to Saturday school, sits properly, absorbs hangul like a disciplined sponge. Polish Zuzia stays home, her ghost playing in the garden, leaving muddy footprints only Mama can see.

### The Report Card Ceremony

Four times a year, we have the Report Card Ceremony. Appa lights candles (not really, but in my mind he does). Mama clutches her wine glass like a shield. I present the document that will determine the house's weather for the next week.

Appa reads out loud: "Mathematics: Excellent. Korean: Very Good. Science: Excellent."

Each "Excellent" makes him grow taller. He becomes a skyscraper of pride, reaching toward Seoul's expectations.

Mama reads the comments: "Soo-jin is very focused but needs to engage more in creative play. She seems anxious about making mistakes."

Each word makes her smaller, folding into herself like origami made of worry.

I want to tell them about the secret report card I keep under my bed. The one where I grade myself:
- Making Mama Laugh: A+
- Knowing When Appa Needs a Hug: A+
- Keeping Peace Between Worlds: A+++
- Being Seven Years Old: C- (needs improvement)

### The Magic Study Room

Appa created a study room that exists in Korean time-space. When you enter, the outside world stops. Polish birds freeze mid-song. The sun forgets to set. Only the desk lamp burns eternal, feeding on children's concentration.

In this room, numbers come alive but not in a fun way. They march in formations, demanding to be multiplied, divided, conquered. Letters line up for inspection. Mistakes are court-martialed and executed.

But I've discovered something Appa doesn't know: if you look at the problems sideways, if you squint just right, the numbers turn into dancing figures. The hangul characters become tiny people with stories. The mathematical symbols transform into musical notes.

This is my resistance. This is how I stay Zuzia while being Soo-jin.

### The Grandmothers' Ghosts

Both grandmothers visit through video calls, their pixelated faces carrying the weight of opposing wisdoms.

Korean Halmoni appears in the computer like a digital deity. "Show me your workbooks," she commands. I hold them up to the camera. She nods approval but it's never enough. Behind her, I see the ghosts of all the Korean children who studied harder - transparent figures hunched over desks, their childhoods sacrificed to the education god.

Polish Babcia materializes in Mama's phone, surrounded by kitchen steam and unconditional love. "Come visit me," she croons. "We'll pick berries and make pierogi." Behind her, I see the ghosts of Polish children who played in forests - wild spirits with earth under their fingernails and songs in their hearts.

Both ghosts pull at me. I am the rope in their cosmic tug-of-war.

### The Night School

This is my secret: after everyone sleeps, I attend Night School. Not a real school - a dream school where Korean discipline and Polish creativity had a baby and that baby became the curriculum.

In Night School, we solve math problems by dancing them. We learn languages by tasting them. History is a garden where we plant seeds of memory and grow understanding. Science is a game where winning means discovering something that makes you gasp with wonder.

The teachers are all the children caught between cultures. We teach each other how to survive in the gaps. How to be excellent and happy. How to honor your parents while honoring yourself.

"The trick," says Miguel (Mexican-Irish), "is to make them think you're doing what they want while actually doing what you need."

"The trick," says Yuki (Japanese-British), "is to become so good at everything that they can't complain about anything."

"The trick," says me, "is to love them so much that their fighting becomes background music to your own song."

### The Translation Magic

I've developed a superpower: I can translate between Korean and Polish, but not just languages - entire worldviews.

When Appa says, "You must work harder," I hear, "I love you so much I want to armor you against every future hurt."

When Mama says, "Just be yourself," I hear, "I love you so much I want you to taste every joy."

When they fight about my schedule, I hear two symphonies trying to play in the same concert hall. Beautiful separately, cacophonous together, unless you find the frequency where they harmonize.

I am that frequency.

### The Multiplication Table Garden

In my mind, I've built a Multiplication Table Garden. It's where Korean mathematics and Polish nature make peace. 

The two-times table grows as daisies - simple, cheerful, paired in friendship. The five-times table bursts forth as sunflowers, bold and predictable. The seven-times table twists as wild vines, beautiful but requiring patience to follow.

When Appa quizzes me, I walk through this garden picking number-flowers. He sees me calculating. He doesn't see me playing. This is how I survive - by making everything both.

### The Freedom Algorithm

I've created the Freedom Algorithm, a mathematical formula for maximizing childhood within parental constraints:

F = (K ร P) รท C + L

Where:
- F is Freedom
- K is Korean accomplishment
- P is Polish play
- C is Conflict
- L is Love (the constant that makes everything possible)

If I score high in Korean accomplishment, I earn Polish play. If I minimize conflict, freedom expands. But love - love is what makes the equation work. Even when the variables seem impossible.

### The Day Everything Changed

Last Tuesday, something extraordinary happened. I was doing Korean math homework while listening to Polish folk music (my small rebellion). The numbers on the page started dancing to the accordion rhythms. Three times four became a waltz. Seven times eight became a polonaise.

"I invented dancing mathematics!" I announced.

Appa frowned. "Mathematics doesn't dance."

Mama smiled. "Everything dances if you have the right music."

They looked at each other. Really looked. And for one moment, I saw them see what I see: that there isn't one right way. That maybe their daughter found a third way.

"Show us," they said together.

So I did. I danced the nine-times table like Korean fan dance. I painted the fractals hidden in Polish paper cuts. I proved that discipline and creativity aren't opposites - they're dance partners waiting for the right song.

### The Continuing Story

I am Soo-jin when I need precision. I am Zuzia when I need possibility. I am both when I'm whole, which is more often now.

The Homework Dragon still visits, but I've taught him to play. He's not very good at it yet, but he's learning. The playground exists every day now, visible even to Korean GPS, because I programmed it in myself.

My parents still fight about education, but now their fights sound different. Less like war, more like jazz - improvisational, sometimes discordant, but creating something new.

"She's falling behind in Korean standards," Appa worries.

"She's ahead in life standards," Mama counters.

"What if she's creating new standards?" I offer.

They stop. They listen. They're learning too.

### The Letter to Future Me

Dear Soo-jin-Zuzia of the future,

Do you remember the taste of two different airs? Do you still see time moving at different speeds? Have you found more children living in the gaps between cultures?

I hope you remember that excellence and joy aren't enemies. That discipline can dance. That freedom has structure. That love speaks all languages, even the silent ones parents use when they're trying not to fight.

I hope you thank them - not for being perfect, but for loving you in stereo. For giving you two worldviews to choose from, mix together, transcend.

I hope you still do mathematics in the garden of your mind. I hope you still translate love into understanding.

But mostly, I hope you remember being seven and containing multitudes.

Love,
Your smaller self who knew the secret: We don't have to choose. We can be everything. We can honor both clocks. We can dance with dragons. We can excel at joy.

### The End That's Also Beginning

Tomorrow is Wednesday. Korean math day and Polish art day. The dragons will come with their worksheets. The forests will call with their freedoms. My parents will pull in different directions, not knowing that I've learned to stretch like taffy, sweet and flexible, holding both ends together.

I am the hyphen in Korean-Polish. Small but mighty. Easy to overlook but essential for connection.

I am seven years old and I am ancient. I am doing multiplication tables and I am saving the world. I am my parents' anxiety and I am my own solution.

My name is Soo-jin-Zuzia and I live in the magical space between Korean ambition and Polish spirit, where anything is possible if you're brave enough to love both sides of everything.

Even yourself.
Especially yourself.
