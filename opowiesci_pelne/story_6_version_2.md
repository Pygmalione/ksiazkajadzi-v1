# Story 6: Drunken Company Dinners - Work culture clash
## Version 2: The Last Round

The call came at 11:47 PM on a Tuesday. I remember the exact time because I'd been watching the clock, waiting for midnight, telling myself that if I made it to Wednesday without incident, everything would be fine.

I was wrong.

"Jadzia?" The voice was barely a whisper, but I recognized it immediately. Anna Nowak, senior analyst at Quantum Systems, the Korean tech giant that had recently acquired three Polish startups in what the business press called "aggressive expansion."

"Anna? What's wrong?"

"I need your help. It's about the hweshik. Something happened. Something bad."

My blood chilled. In my five years as a cultural consultant for Korean-Polish business relations, I'd heard every hweshik horror story imaginable. But Anna's voice carried something different. Fear.

"Where are you?"

"Nowy Świat. Bar Bambino. Please come. Come alone."

The line went dead.

I found Anna in the darkest corner of the bar, nursing what looked like her fourth vodka. Her usually immaculate blazer was wrinkled, her mascara smudged. She looked like she'd aged ten years since I'd last seen her at the cultural orientation workshop two months ago.

"They said it was just dinner," she began without preamble. "Team building. Cultural integration. All the buzzwords."

I slid into the booth across from her. "Start from the beginning."

Anna's hands trembled as she lifted her glass. "You know how it is. The acquisition happened six months ago. At first, they kept things separate. Polish management for Polish teams, Korean oversight from Seoul. Professional distance. It worked."

"What changed?"

"New Director of Integration. Kim Sung-ho. Arrived three weeks ago with a mandate to 'harmonize corporate cultures.' He scheduled mandatory hweshiks. Weekly."

"Weekly?" I couldn't hide my surprise. Even in Korea, weekly mandatory drinking sessions were extreme.

"Every Thursday. Said it was the only way to build trust. Break down barriers. You know the rhetoric."

I did. I'd written half of it for companies trying to navigate the cultural minefield of international mergers. But something in Anna's eyes told me this went beyond typical cultural friction.

"The first two were normal," she continued. "Awkward, sure. Polish staff leaving after the first round, Koreans looking disappointed but understanding. Cultural differences, everyone shrugged. But Kim wasn't satisfied."

She paused, staring into her vodka as if it held answers.

"Last Thursday, he announced new rules. Minimum three rounds. No exceptions. Said anyone who left early would be noted in performance reviews. Called it 'commitment to team cohesion.'"

"That's illegal under Polish labor law—"

"You think Kim cares?" Anna's laugh was bitter. "He has the CEO's ear. The acquisition gave them controlling interest. Polish law becomes... flexible when profit margins are involved."

I'd seen it before. The dark side of cultural integration, where respect became coercion, tradition became weapon. But Anna's story was just beginning.

"Tonight was different. Third hweshik under the new rules. By the second round, people were desperate. You have to understand—these aren't young singles who can recover from all-nighters. These are parents, people with obligations, health conditions."

"What happened in the third round?"

Anna's eyes darted toward the door, checking for shadows that weren't there. "Kim had been watching. Making notes. Who drank slowly. Who made excuses. Who looked uncomfortable. In the third round, he started calling people out. Personal challenges. Drinking games with punishment stakes."

"Punishment?"

"Project assignments. Team reshuffling. Subtle threats wrapped in drinking games. But that wasn't the worst part."

She leaned forward, voice dropping to barely audible. "Tomasz Kowalski. You know him? Senior developer, fifteen years with the company. Diabetes. He'd been nursing one beer all night, thought no one noticed."

My stomach tightened. I knew where this was going.

"Kim called him out. Made a speech about trust, about sharing burdens, about how in Korea, refusing a drink from your superior was like refusing friendship. Kept pouring soju, pushing the glass forward. The whole table watching."

"He drank?"

"He drank. And kept drinking. Pride, fear, peer pressure—toxic cocktail worse than any alcohol. By 2 AM, his blood sugar was catastrophic. We called an ambulance."

"Jesus. Is he—"

"Alive. In the hospital. But Kim?" Anna's voice turned ice cold. "Kim said it was unfortunate but educational. That now everyone understood the importance of 'full participation.'"

I felt rage building but kept my voice steady. This was about more than cultural insensitivity. This was systematic abuse disguised as tradition.

"There's more," Anna whispered. "The Polish employees are organizing. Quietly. Documenting everything. Building a case. But we need someone who understands both sides. Someone who can navigate the cultural minefield without triggering suspicion."

"You want me to go undercover?"

"Not undercover. Consultant. Kim wants to expand the program. Make it a model for all Korean acquisitions in Poland. He's looking for cultural experts to legitimize it. Your reputation..."

She didn't need to finish. My reputation as a bridge-builder, someone who helped companies navigate Korean-Polish cultural differences, made me perfect for Kim's purposes. And perfect for Anna's.

"When?"

"Thursday. There's a special hweshik planned. Kim's bringing in executives from Seoul, wants to showcase his 'integration success.' He needs a cultural consultant to observe and validate."

I made my decision. "Send me the official request. Make it look routine."

Anna's relief was palpable. "Be careful. Kim's not just ambitious. He's smart. He'll test you."

She was right.

Thursday arrived wrapped in November fog. The restaurant—Silla Dynasty, Korean BBQ with private rooms—squatted on Marszałkowska like a neon promise of cultural harmony. I arrived early, credentials in hand, observer notebook prominently displayed.

Kim Sung-ho greeted me personally. Mid-forties, immaculate suit, smile that never reached his eyes. His handshake lasted a beat too long, assessing.

"Ms. Kim, your reputation precedes you. The woman who teaches Poles to survive hweshik culture."

"I prefer to think of it as cultural bridge-building," I replied carefully.

"Bridges can be walked both ways," he said. "Tonight, you'll see how Korean dedication can inspire Polish colleagues to new heights of... cohesion."

The private room was already set. Thirty people, evenly split between Korean management and Polish staff. I recognized the signs immediately—Poles clustered defensively, Koreans relaxed but watchful, the air thick with unspoken tension.

I took my observer position, notebook ready. The first hour followed standard hweshik protocol. Food, formal toasts, careful conversation. But I noticed things. Kim's assistant tracking drinks on a tablet. Security cameras in corners, red lights blinking. The doors—heavy, soundproofed, locks on the inside.

This wasn't team building. This was a pressure cooker.

By the second round, Kim's strategy became clear. He'd seated Polish employees strategically, surrounded by Korean managers. No escape routes. No allies within easy reach. Classic isolation tactics.

"Ms. Kim," he called out during a brief lull. "Perhaps you could explain to our Polish colleagues the deep cultural significance of sseom-ta-da—the Korean concept of sensing someone's true character through drinking."

A test. I chose my words carefully. "It's a complex concept. The idea that alcohol reveals authentic personality. But like many cultural concepts, it requires context and consent to be meaningful."

His smile tightened. "Consent? In Korea, we trust our superiors' judgment. Perhaps that's a cultural lesson our Polish friends still need to learn."

The threat hung in the air like smoke. Around the table, Polish faces had gone pale. They knew what was coming. So did I.

Third round began at 11 PM. Kim produced bottles of premium soju, began personal toasts. Each one targeted, specific, designed to probe weakness. The marketing manager with the sick child at home. The accountant with the history of liver problems. The young intern, six months pregnant, trying to hide it.

I documented everything, pen moving steadily. Evidence. Witnesses. The camera in my pen recording every word.

Then Kim turned to me.

"Ms. Kim, surely you'll join us for a toast? To cultural understanding?"

The room held its breath. This was the trap. Refuse, and I'd lose credibility, be dismissed as another outsider who didn't truly understand. Accept, and I'd become complicit.

I stood slowly. "In my culture—both Korean and Polish—we have a saying. 'The wise leader knows when to lead and when to serve.' Tonight, I serve by observing. But I toast with water to honor both traditions—Korean respect and Polish choice."

His eyes narrowed. For a moment, the mask slipped, and I saw the calculation underneath. Then he laughed, bright and false.

"Diplomatic. But diplomacy has limits, doesn't it? Mr. Kowalski learned that last week."

The room froze. He'd just admitted it. On camera. In front of witnesses.

"Speaking of limits," I said quietly, "I believe Polish labor law has several regarding mandatory after-hours activities. Article 94 of the Labor Code, if I recall correctly."

"Laws change. Companies evolve. Poland wants Korean investment, doesn't it? Sometimes evolution requires... discomfort."

Around the table, something shifted. The Polish employees straightening slightly. The Korean managers looking uncertain. Kim had overplayed his hand.

"Evolution, yes," I agreed. "But not extinction. The most successful integrations preserve what's valuable in both cultures. Korean innovation with Polish work-life balance. Korean teamwork with Polish individual rights. That's what the Seoul headquarters expects, isn't it? Successful integration, not cultural colonization?"

I'd gambled on the Seoul executives watching remotely—another test within the test. Kim's face confirmed it.

The rest of the evening became a delicate dance. Kim trying to regain control, me deflecting, the Polish employees finding courage in small rebellions. Bathroom breaks became extended. Phones appeared, messages sent. The intern excused herself entirely, citing pregnancy—no longer hidden, now shield.

By 1 AM, the facade cracked completely. A senior Polish manager, emboldened by numbers and evidence, simply stood up.

"Thank you for dinner. In Poland, we say 'everything in moderation.' Good night."

One departure became two. Then five. Then a quiet exodus, leaving Kim with his diminishing circle of Korean managers and a room full of empty chairs.

He turned to me, mask entirely gone now. "You've ruined everything."

"I've documented everything," I corrected. "There's a difference."

The next morning, Anna called. "The Seoul executives requested all footage from last night. HR is launching an investigation. Kim's on administrative leave."

"And the Polish staff?"

"Free. Thursday nights are their own again. The new integration policy focuses on lunch meetings and voluntary cultural exchanges. Actual bridges, not forced marches."

But the story doesn't end there. Kim disappeared—transferred, they said, to another division, another country, another attempt at forced harmony. The Polish employees formed their own support network, sharing strategies for navigating Korean corporate culture without losing themselves.

And me? I kept consulting, but with new purpose. Each workshop now included a section on recognition and resistance—how to identify when cultural tradition becomes weapon, when integration becomes assimilation, when respect becomes coercion.

The real lesson of that November night wasn't about Korean drinking culture or Polish resistance. It was about power—how it hides behind tradition, uses culture as camouflage, turns celebration into control.

Six months later, I received a package. No return address. Inside, a bottle of premium soju and a note: "For the bridge builder who burned the bridge. Sometimes necessary. —A friend in Seoul."

I keep that bottle on my desk. Unopened. A reminder that cultural understanding sometimes means knowing when to say no. That bridges should connect, not trap. That the most important toasts are the ones we refuse to drink.

Every Thursday at 11:47 PM, I think about that call from Anna. About Tomasz in his hospital bed. About the intern protecting her unborn child. About all the employees in all the companies where someone confuses culture with control.

And I write. Document. Teach. Build better bridges.

Because in the end, the most dangerous drinking game isn't about alcohol. It's about power. And the only way to win is to refuse to play.

The phone rings. Another late-night call. Another voice trembling with fear or anger or both. Another company where someone thinks tradition justifies tyranny.

"Jadzia? I need your help. It's about the company dinner..."

I reach for my pen, my recorder, my armor of cultural knowledge and labor law.

"Tell me everything," I say. "From the beginning."

The work continues. The bridges need building. But now we build them with escape routes included.

Just in case.
