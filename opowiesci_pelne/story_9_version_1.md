# Story 9: Language of Love - Formal vs. informal speech
## Version 1: Lost in Honorifics (Romantic Comedy Style)

You know that moment when you realize you've been accidentally insulting your boyfriend's entire family for six months? No? Just me? Well, let me tell you about the most linguistically disastrous romance in the history of Korean-Polish relationships.

It started innocently enough at a language exchange meetup in Warsaw's Koreatown. I was there to practice my Korean—I'd been studying for two years and was confident I could at least order food without accidentally asking for a divorce. He was there to improve his Polish, which he'd been learning for exactly three weeks and could successfully say "Dzień dobry" and "Czy to jest pierogi?"

His name was Minho, and the first thing he said to me was, "Annyeonghaseyo, jeoneun Minho-imnida." Very formal, very proper. So naturally, I responded with "Cześć, jestem Jadzia," because nothing says cultural sensitivity like responding to formal Korean with the Polish equivalent of "Hey, I'm Jadzia."

The look on his face should have been my first clue. It was a mixture of confusion, shock, and what I now recognize as "Oh no, I've matched with a linguistic barbarian." But at the time, I just thought he was processing the Polish pronunciation.

"Ah, Jadzia-ssi," he said carefully, and I swear he physically backed up a step. "Nice to meet you."

"Just Jadzia is fine!" I said cheerfully in Korean, using what I thought was friendly banmal. "We're the same age, right? No need to be formal!"

Reader, we were not the same age. He was thirty-two. I was twenty-eight. In Korean age calculation, that made him practically my ancestor. But did I know this? Of course not. I'd learned Korean from dramas where everyone falls in love and immediately drops all formalities by episode three.

For the next hour, I chatted away in casual Korean while he responded in increasingly formal Polish, which he was clearly looking up on his phone. It was like linguistic ping-pong where neither of us understood the rules.

"Czy mogę zaproponować Pani kawę?" he asked, somehow managing to use the formal "Pani" that my grandmother's friends use.

"Sure! Let's get coffee!" I responded in Korean, using the casual form I'd use with my best friend.

The coffee date was a masterclass in mixed signals. He pulled out my chair (sweet!), addressed me as "Jadzia-ssi" (formal but okay), and then asked about my family using honorifics so high I'm pretty sure he was implying my parents were royalty.

Meanwhile, I was chatting away like we'd known each other since kindergarten, using Korean slang I'd picked up from variety shows. At one point, I actually said "ya!" to get his attention—a word so informal it's basically the equivalent of "hey you!" to someone older.

His eye twitched.

"Did I say something wrong?" I asked, finally noticing his discomfort.

"No, no," he said quickly in Polish. "Proszę kontynuować." Please continue. Like I was giving a presentation.

Despite the linguistic chaos, we somehow ended up dating. Our text messages were a comedy of errors. He'd send paragraphs in formal Korean, complete with proper endings and respectful vocabulary. I'd respond with "ㅋㅋㅋ okay~" and enough emoticons to populate a small digital village.

My Korean teacher, upon reviewing our conversations (yes, I showed them to her, I was desperate), nearly fainted.

"Jadzia," she said slowly, "you're talking to him like he's your little brother. No, worse. Like he's your pet."

"But we're dating!" I protested. "Aren't couples supposed to use casual language?"

"After marriage, maybe," she said. "Maybe. If he's very modern."

The real disaster came when I met his parents. I'd practiced formal greetings for weeks. I knew how to bow, how to receive gifts with both hands, how to pour tea at the proper angle. What I didn't know was that Korean formality is like an onion—just when you think you've reached the core, there's another layer of honorifics waiting to make you cry.

"Annyeong!" I said brightly to his mother, using the casual greeting I'd use with friends. The silence that followed could have frozen kimchi.

Minho quickly jumped in with damage control, but the damage was done. I'd essentially greeted his mother like she was my drinking buddy. The rest of the dinner was spent with me overcompensating, using honorifics so incorrectly that at one point I referred to myself in the third person royal we.

"Would the mother-in-law like more tea?" I asked, except I used the wrong level of "mother-in-law" and accidentally implied she was already my mother-in-law, which in Korean culture is presumptuous enough to cause generational shame.

His mother responded in perfect English: "Just call me Mrs. Park."

The Polish side wasn't much better. When Minho met my parents, he insisted on using "Pan" and "Pani" with such frequency that my dad thought he was being sarcastic.

"Why does he keep calling me 'Sir Lord'?" my dad whispered to me in the kitchen. "Is this some kind of Korean joke?"

"He's being respectful!" I hissed back.

"Respectful? He asked for permission to pass the salt! I feel like I'm in a Jane Austen novel."

The formality wars escalated. Minho couldn't adjust to Polish directness, and I couldn't master Korean hierarchy. We'd go to restaurants and have entire conversations about who should order first based on age, social status, and who was paying. By the time we figured it out, the waiter had usually given up and moved to another table.

"Just order!" I'd say in exasperation.

"But you're the guest!" he'd insist.

"We're both guests! It's a restaurant!"

"But I invited you!"

"Three weeks ago! The statute of limitations on invitation hierarchy has expired!"

Our friends started taking bets on how long we'd last. The Korean-Polish couples' group we joined was divided—half thought the language barrier would doom us, half thought it was romantic in a "lost in translation" way.

"It's like watching a K-drama," said Gosia, whose Korean husband had long since given up on formal Polish. "Except instead of noble idiocy keeping them apart, it's grammar."

The breaking point came during a trip to Seoul to meet his extended family. I'd prepared. I'd studied. I'd memorized formal greetings for every possible relative. What I hadn't prepared for was the complexity of Korean workplace hierarchy when we stopped by his office.

"This is my girlfriend," Minho introduced me to his team, using a level of formality that suggested I was visiting diplomat.

Panic mode. Do I match his formality? Go higher? Lower? I went with what I thought was safe middle ground and ended up speaking to his junior colleagues like they were elders and his boss like he was a casual acquaintance. The social calculus required was making my brain hurt.

"Why is Korean so complicated?" I wailed later in our hotel room. "In Polish, it's simple. Formal for strangers and elders, informal for everyone else. Two choices. Binary. Easy!"

"Polish is not easy!" Minho protested. "You have case endings that change based on gender, number, and function. Korean just has respect levels!"

"Just? JUST? You have seven speech levels! SEVEN! And that's not counting honorific vocabulary!"

"Polish has seven cases!"

"Cases are grammar! Honorifics are social navigation! It's completely different!"

We stared at each other across the linguistic divide. Then Minho said something that changed everything:

"Saranghae."

I love you. In banmal. Casual, intimate, informal banmal.

"Did you just..." I started.

"I'm tired of being formal with you," he said in Korean, still using banmal. "I know it's not traditional. I know my mother will be horrified. But I'm thirty-two years old, and I want to talk to my girlfriend like she's my girlfriend, not a business associate."

"Your eye isn't twitching," I observed.

"I'm overriding the twitch with the power of love," he said solemnly, then ruined it by grinning.

From that night on, we instituted what we called "Code-Switching Hours." From 9 AM to 6 PM, we'd practice proper formal Korean and Polish, helping each other navigate professional and social situations. After 6 PM, all bets were off. Banmal, slang, pet names that would horrify traditionalists—we used them all.

"Ya!" I'd call out, and he'd respond without flinching.

"Kochanie," he'd say, mangling the Polish endearment so badly it sounded like he was clearing his throat, but I loved it anyway.

His mother took longer to come around. The turning point was when she heard me talking to my own mother in Polish—casual, interrupting each other, laughing and arguing simultaneously.

"Is that... normal?" she asked Minho in Korean.

"Polish normal," he explained. "They show love by being informal."

She looked thoughtful. The next time I visited, she said, "Just call me eomeoni." Mother. Still formal, but Korean-family formal, not stranger formal. Progress.

My parents adapted faster, probably because Minho's excessive formality had nowhere to go but down. The day he finally called my dad "Tato" instead of "Pan Kowalski," my dad actually hugged him.

"Thank God," he said. "I was starting to feel like I should wear a crown to dinner."

We've been married for three years now, and our language situation is... unique. We speak what our friends call "Korpolish"—a hybrid monster of both languages with grammar rules that would make linguists weep.

"Jagiya, can you podaj mi the kimchi?" (Honey, can you pass me the kimchi?)

"Ne, ale you have to say proszę." (Yes, but you have to say please.)

"I said jagiya! That's the magic word in Korean!"

"We're in Poland. Polish magic words apply."

Our wedding was a masterpiece of linguistic compromise. The ceremony was bilingual, with translations that occasionally went hilariously wrong. When the officiant asked if anyone objected, the Korean translation somehow implied we were asking for financial contributions.

"That explains the envelopes," Minho's confused cousin whispered.

Our vows were delivered in both languages, with levels of formality that varied wildly depending on who we were looking at. I promised to love him "forever and always" in casual Korean while maintaining eye contact with his mother, who visibly flinched but smiled through it.

The real test came when we had our daughter. The great grandparents wanted formal respect. The grandparents wanted traditional hierarchy. We wanted our child to not need a flowchart to figure out how to address relatives.

"She can call me Babcia," my mother declared. "None of this 'Grandmother Ma'am' nonsense."

"Halmeoni," Minho's mother countered, then added hopefully, "with proper endings?"

We compromised. Our daughter, now two, calls my parents "Babcia" and "Dziadek" with reckless informality and addresses Minho's parents as "Halmeoni" and "Harabeoji" with randomly applied honorifics that change based on her mood and sugar intake.

"Halmeoni-ya!" she yelled last week, adding the casual vocative ending to the formal grandmother title. The look on my mother-in-law's face was priceless—a combination of horror and grandmotherly love that transcended linguistic propriety.

"She's creative with language," Minho said diplomatically.

"She's a linguistic terrorist," I corrected. "She gets it from both sides."

These days, I can navigate Korean formality with reasonable success. I still occasionally call someone's grandmother "dude," but my recovery time has improved dramatically. Minho has mastered the Polish art of interrupting and talking over people to show engagement, though he still apologizes after every interjection.

"Sorry, continue," he'll say after cutting me off mid-sentence.

"That defeats the purpose of interrupting!" I laugh. "If you're going to interrupt, commit to it!"

Our couple friends find us either inspiring or exhausting, depending on their own linguistic journey. We run a support group for Korean-Polish couples called "Lost in Translation: A Survival Guide," where we teach important phrases like:

- How to politely refuse a seventh shot of soju (impossible, but we try)
- How to explain Polish directness isn't rudeness (ongoing project)
- Emergency phrases for when you accidentally use banmal with your father-in-law (grovel in both languages)
- How to teach your children two completely different communication styles without giving them an identity crisis (jury's still out)

The most common question we get is: "Which language do you fight in?"

The answer is both, neither, and something in between. Our arguments sound like a linguistic ping-pong match:

"I can't believe you said that to my mother!"
"I was being respectful!"
"You called her 'young lady'!"
"That's respectful in Korean!"
"She's seventy!"
"Exactly! Young for a grandmother!"
"That's not how Polish works!"
"Well, Polish doesn't work how Korean works either!"
"Obviously, or we wouldn't be having this conversation!"
"Are we fighting about grammar again?"
"WE'RE ALWAYS FIGHTING ABOUT GRAMMAR!"

Then we usually laugh because honestly, if you're going to have a multicultural relationship, you either learn to find the humor in linguistic chaos or you go insane.

The truth is, language shapes how we see the world. Korean taught me to be aware of social hierarchies and the importance of showing respect through speech. Polish taught Minho that sometimes directness is its own form of respect, that informality can mean intimacy rather than rudeness.

Our daughter will grow up switching between worlds, hopefully taking the best from both. She'll know when to bow and when to hug, when to use honorifics and when to just call someone by their name. She'll understand that love can be expressed in formal declarations and casual teasing, in respectful distance and aggressive closeness.

Or she'll just continue calling her grandmother "dude" in Korean and give everyone heart attacks. Either way, she'll be perfectly bilingual in her own unique way.

Last week, I heard her playing with her dolls, making them have a tea party. One doll was speaking in formal Korean to another doll who responded in casual Polish. Then they switched. Then they mixed both languages into some hybrid monster that somehow made perfect sense in the context of teddy bears sharing plastic cookies.

"She's code-switching," Minho said proudly.

"She's creating her own language," I corrected.

"Isn't that what we did?"

I looked at him—my husband who still sometimes calls my mother "Pani Mama" and who taught me that love sometimes means suffering through seven levels of formality just to say "pass the salt."

"Yeah," I admitted. "I guess we did."

And honestly? I wouldn't have it any other way. Even if it means spending the rest of my life explaining to confused relatives why my husband calls them "Sir" and why I occasionally address his elderly aunts like they're my college roommates.

Love is complicated enough without adding linguistic barriers. But somehow, navigating those barriers together—arguing about honorifics, laughing at translation fails, creating our own hybrid language of love—made our relationship stronger.

Plus, our daughter's first word was "annyeong" said with perfect Polish intonation, so clearly we're doing something right.

Or wrong. In two languages.

But definitely together.
