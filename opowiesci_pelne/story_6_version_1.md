# Story 6: Drunken Company Dinners - Work culture clash
## Version 1: The Soju Survival Guide

So, let me tell you about my friend Magda—actually, she's more like my cousin's best friend's roommate, but in the Korean-Polish community in Warsaw, that basically makes us family. Anyway, Magda called me last week, completely panicked, asking if I could teach her how to survive a Korean company dinner. I nearly choked on my kimchi.

"Wait, wait, wait," I said, putting down my chopsticks. "You, Magdalena Kowalska, who once told me that mixing work and personal life is like mixing vodka with milk—a terrible idea that will only make you sick—you're going to a hweshik?"

"My boyfriend's boss invited me," she groaned. "Apparently, it's a big deal. Jaehyun says I can't say no."

Ah, Jaehyun. The poor Korean guy who'd somehow convinced Magda to date him despite her rule about never dating anyone who worked more than forty hours a week. I'd met him once at a pierogi-kimchi fusion dinner party (don't ask), and he seemed nice enough, though he had that slightly shell-shocked look that all Korean men get when they date Polish women.

"Okay," I said, already mentally preparing my lesson plan. "Come over. Bring notepads. This is going to take a while."

When Magda arrived at my apartment, she looked like she was preparing for war. She had a notebook, three different pens, and what appeared to be a Korean phrasebook from 1987.

"First things first," I said, pouring her some makgeolli. "You need to understand what you're getting into. A hweshik isn't just dinner. It's... how do I explain this... imagine if your boss could legally force you to get drunk with him and call it team building."

Magda's eyes widened. "That's legal?"

"Not force force," I clarified. "But there's this unspoken rule. If you don't go, you're not a team player. If you don't drink, you're not trustworthy. If you leave early, you might as well start updating your resume."

"But that's insane!" Magda protested. "In Poland, if my boss asked me to drink with him after work, I'd report him to HR!"

"Welcome to Korean corporate culture," I said, raising my glass. "Where HR probably organized the whole thing."

I started with the basics. "Okay, so there are usually three rounds. Cha, i-cha, sam-cha. First round is dinner and beer or soju. Pretty civilized. You can handle that, right?"

Magda nodded confidently. "I'm Polish. I can handle alcohol."

"Oh, sweet summer child," I laughed. "This isn't about handling alcohol. This is about handling alcohol while navigating a complex social hierarchy, maintaining perfect etiquette, and somehow bonding with people you'll have to face in a professional setting tomorrow morning."

I explained the pouring rules. Never pour your own drink. Always pour for others with both hands. Turn away from elders when drinking. Accept drinks with both hands. The glass should never be empty. But also, pace yourself because there are multiple rounds.

"This is more complicated than my master's thesis," Magda muttered, scribbling notes furiously.

"Wait, it gets better," I continued. "Second round is usually karaoke. You'll have to sing."

"I don't sing."

"You do now. Pick something everyone knows. Don't be too good—that's showing off. But don't be too bad—that's not trying. Aim for endearingly mediocre."

"Endearingly mediocre," she repeated, writing it down. "Like my cooking."

"Exactly! And third round... well, third round is where things get messy. Could be more drinking, could be a pojangmacha—street food tent—could be a room salon if you're really unlucky."

"Room salon?"

"Private karaoke rooms with... let's call them professional companions. Hopefully Jaehyun's company isn't that old school."

Magda looked ready to call the whole thing off, so I quickly moved on to survival tactics.

"Look, the key is to find allies. The other women, if there are any, will help you. There's usually one designated driver or someone who can't drink for medical reasons—stick close to them. And here's a pro tip: eat everything. The food isn't just food, it's a alcohol-absorption system."

We practiced pouring techniques with water bottles, and I taught her a few key phrases. "Jal meokkessseumnida" before eating. "Geonbae" for cheers. And most importantly, "Hwajangsil eodi-eyo?"—where's the bathroom?

"What about getting out of drinking?" she asked hopefully.

"You can try the foreigner card, but use it sparingly. Say you're taking antibiotics—that usually works. Or volunteer to be the photographer. They love documentation, and it's hard to drink when you're holding a camera."

The night of the hweshik, I made Magda text me updates. They started coming around 7 PM.

**7:15 PM**: "At Korean BBQ place. So much meat. Boss already red-faced. Send help."

**7:47 PM**: "Why does everyone keep making me do love shots with Jaehyun? What is a love shot? We're just linking arms and drinking, right? RIGHT?"

**8:23 PM**: "Plot twist. The boss's wife is Polish. She's teaching everyone Polish drinking songs. I think I love her."

**9:06 PM**: "Karaoke time. They have 'Hej Sokoły.' I repeat, THEY HAVE HEJ SOKOŁY. This changes everything."

**9:52 PM**: "Duet with boss to 'My Way.' He cried. I think I'm getting promoted. Or fired. Unclear."

**10:44 PM**: "I-cha done. Survived. The Polish wife taught me secret. Zakąski! She brought Polish pickles. PICKLES, JADZIA. Game changer."

**11:38 PM**: "At pojangmacha. Taught them Polish tongue twisters. They taught me Korean ones. Nobody can pronounce anything. United in linguistic failure."

**12:27 AM**: "Boss just called me 'our Polish warrior.' Gave speech about international cooperation. Everyone clapped. I might be drunk."

**1:15 AM**: "Home. Alive. Jaehyun says I'm invited to next one. Not sure if threat or compliment."

The next morning, Magda called me, surprisingly coherent for someone who'd survived their first hweshik.

"So?" I asked. "How was it?"

"You know what the weird thing is?" she said slowly. "I kind of get it now. Not the mandatory part—that's still crazy. But the bonding thing? By the end of the night, I knew more about Jaehyun's coworkers than I know about my own team after two years."

"Really?"

"His boss told me about his daughter's piano recital. The finance guy admitted he's scared of his mother-in-law. The intern taught me a card game. It was like... imagine if pierogi-making was mandatory at Polish companies."

"That's actually not a bad analogy," I admitted.

"I mean, I still think it's insane," Magda continued. "The pressure to drink, the obligation, the mixing of personal and professional—it goes against everything I believe about work-life balance. But I can see why Jaehyun doesn't just quit. They're like a weird, dysfunctional, alcohol-fueled family."

"Welcome to the Korean-Polish cultural exchange program," I laughed. "Where Polish drinking capacity meets Korean drinking obligations."

"The boss's Polish wife was the real MVP though," Magda added. "She told me she's been navigating this for fifteen years. Started bringing Polish snacks to hweshiks. Now it's tradition. Last month she introduced them to żurek as a hangover cure."

"Strategic cultural infiltration. I like it."

"She invited me to their wives' club. Apparently, it's a support group for non-Korean spouses surviving Korean corporate culture. They meet monthly to drink wine and complain."

"So basically a Polish gathering," I noted.

"Exactly! But with better kimchi."

Over the next few months, Magda became something of a hweshik legend. She introduced the concept of "pre-gaming" with Polish appetizers. She taught them Polish card games that were somehow even more complicated than Korean drinking games. She even started a tradition of ending third rounds with oscypek from her aunt's farm in Zakopane.

But the real test came when her own company—a very Polish, very traditional accounting firm—tried to implement "team building dinners" after the CEO attended an international management conference.

"You have to help me," Magda pleaded over the phone. "They want to do monthly mandatory team dinners. With activities. And sharing circles."

"Oh no," I said. "They're trying to import hweshik culture without understanding it."

"It's worse. They hired a consultant. He suggested trust falls and alcohol-free bonding exercises. The Korean model but make it corporate wellness."

"That's like kimchi without fermentation," I said. "Technically vegetable, but missing the point entirely."

So Magda did what any Polish person would do when faced with corporate nonsense—she weaponized malicious compliance. She organized the most Polish team dinner possible. Formal dress code. Assigned seating by seniority. Seven-course meal with strict etiquette rules. No phones. No leaving early. And absolutely no fun allowed until exactly 9 PM, when work hours officially ended.

"It was brutal," she reported gleefully. "Three hours of forced formality. By the time I finally said they could relax and have a beer, they were begging for mercy. The CEO said maybe monthly was too ambitious. Maybe quarterly. Maybe optional."

"You used Polish formality to defeat corporate team building?" I asked, impressed.

"Fight culture with culture," she shrugged. "The Koreans force you to get drunk and sing? We force you to use the correct fork for fish course while making small talk about the weather."

Jaehyun, who'd been listening to our conversation, shook his head. "You realize you just did exactly what hweshik does, right? Used cultural expectations to enforce group bonding?"

Magda froze. "Oh my God. I became what I swore to destroy."

"No," I corrected. "You became culturally bilingual. You code-switch between Korean collective drinking and Polish formal distance."

"Is that what we're calling it?" she laughed. "Because it feels more like cultural schizophrenia."

These days, Magda navigates both worlds with surprising grace. She knows when to pour soju with both hands and when to maintain professional distance. She can sing Korean ballads at noraebang and enforce Polish meeting protocols with equal skill. She even started a cross-cultural corporate communication workshop, teaching Poles about Korean relationship-building and Koreans about Polish work-life boundaries.

"The secret," she told me recently, "is understanding that both cultures are trying to solve the same problem—how to build trust and teamwork. Koreans do it by breaking down barriers with alcohol. Poles do it by respecting barriers and slowly earning trust. Neither way is wrong. They're just different."

"Very philosophical for someone who once called hweshik 'sanctioned workplace alcoholism,'" I teased.

"Oh, it totally is," she agreed cheerfully. "But it's sanctioned workplace alcoholism with heart. And kimchi. And surprisingly effective team building once you get past the liver damage."

Her Polish company eventually found a middle ground—optional monthly dinners with a two-drink maximum and a hard stop at 8 PM. The Korean company, influenced by the Polish wives' club, instituted "Polish Fridays" where leaving on time was encouraged and after-work activities were genuinely voluntary.

"Look at you, building cultural bridges," I said.

"More like building cultural survival strategies," she corrected. "But yeah, maybe a little bridge building too."

The real test came when both companies decided to merge—the Polish accounting firm and the Korean tech company where Jaehyun worked. The announcement came with promises of "cultural synergy" and "best practices from both organizations."

"They want me to plan the merger celebration," Magda told me, looking panicked. "A joint hweshik-corporate dinner hybrid. How is that even possible?"

"Easy," I said. "First round, Polish formal dinner. Second round, Korean karaoke. Third round, pierogi and soju at a pojangmacha."

"You're joking."

"I'm not! Think about it—structure for the Poles, bonding for the Koreans, food to keep everyone alive."

And that's exactly what she did. The merger dinner became legendary in Warsaw's Korean-Polish business community. It started with a formal sit-down dinner (Polish style) but with Korean BBQ (interactive cooking builds relationships). The speeches were kept short (Polish efficiency) but included personal anecdotes (Korean warmth). The karaoke portion was optional but incentivized—sing a song, get a pierogi.

"The key," Magda explained later, "was making sure everyone felt slightly uncomfortable but equally uncomfortable. The Poles had to be more social than they liked. The Koreans had to be more formal than they preferred. But everyone was in the same boat."

The Polish CEO and Korean CEO ended the night doing a duet of "Gangnam Style" while the Polish wives' club taught everyone the "Sto lat" birthday song, even though it was nobody's birthday.

"It was chaos," Magda admitted. "But productive chaos. Like a cross-cultural trash fire that somehow produced team bonding."

These days, the merged company has what they call "Flex Fridays"—alternating between Polish-style early dismissal and Korean-style team dinners. The employee handbook includes both pierogi recipes and hangover cure recommendations. The HR department offers cultural navigation workshops led by the Polish wives' club.

And Magda? She's now the official Director of Cross-Cultural Integration, a position that didn't exist until she proved it was desperately needed.

"Never thought my inability to say no to a dinner invitation would become a career path," she told me over coffee and kimchi-pierogi (yes, that's a thing now).

"You know what this means?" I said. "You're going to have to go to a lot more hweshiks."

"I know," she sighed dramatically. "The sacrifices I make for cultural understanding. Pass the soju."

As I watched her expertly pour makgeolli with both hands while explaining Polish labor law to a confused Korean intern, I realized something. The beauty of our Korean-Polish community isn't in choosing one culture over the other. It's in finding ways to honor both, even when they seem completely incompatible.

Whether that means bringing pickles to hweshik or teaching "Hej Sokoły" at karaoke, we find ways to make it work. Because at the end of the day, whether you're bonding over soju or maintaining professional distance over formal dinner, we're all just trying to figure out how to work together without killing each other.

And if that requires a little sanctioned alcoholism or enforced formality? Well, as Magda says, that's just the price of cultural bilingualism.

Though next time someone suggests a Polish-Korean corporate merger, maybe we should just suggest they stick to food. Kimchi-pierogi is much less complicated than trying to merge drinking cultures.

But then again, where's the fun in that?
