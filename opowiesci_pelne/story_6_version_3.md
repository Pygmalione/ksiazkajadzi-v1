**[Email Draft - Never Sent]**  
*From: Jadzia Kim*  
*To: David Kim (Seoul HQ)*  
*Subject: Re: Quarterly Integration Report*

David,

Regarding your request for feedback on the Warsaw office integration:

The Polish team has shown remarkable adaptability to Korean corporate culture while maintaining their own cultural identity. The key to success has been finding middle ground‚Äîrespecting Korean emphasis on team bonding while acknowledging Polish values of work-life balance.

Mr. Park's enthusiasm for cultural exchange has been... memorable. His willingness to embrace Polish customs (including their drinking songs) has created unexpected bridges. Though perhaps monthly hweshik was ambitious for the Warsaw context.

I recommend continuing with the coffee meeting format, with quarterly team dinners as special occasions. This respects both cultures while preventing what the Polish delicately call "liver exhaustion."

Also, a note: the Polish team's creativity in navigating cultural challenges (religious conversions, strategic photography, synchronized bathroom breaks) demonstrates the kind of innovative thinking that benefits international companies. Perhaps less pressure and more trust might yield even better results.

Best regards,  
Jadzia

P.S. - Mr. Park's Polish anthem rendition has gone viral in the Warsaw office. He's something of a folk hero now. Sometimes the best integration happens accidentally.

[NEW DRAFT]

David,

Integration proceeding well. Both teams finding balance. Quarterly dinners recommended.

Best,  
Jadzia

*Compiled by Jadzia Kim from Warsaw Office WhatsApp archives, 2024. Some messages edited for clarity and privacy. Bartek is still "orthodox" for corporate purposes. The Polish Survival Squad continues to meet monthly for moral support and strategic planning. Mr. Park has learned all words to "Hej Soko≈Çy" and requests it at every gathering. The Seoul office has not been informed of this development.*
