# Story 6: Drunken Company Dinners - Work culture clash
## Version 4: Navigating the Soju-Vodka Divide: An Ethnographic Study of Korean-Polish Corporate Integration Through Ritualized Alcohol Consumption

**Abstract**

This ethnographic study examines the cultural tensions arising from the implementation of Korean hweshik (회식) drinking culture in Polish corporate environments following a wave of acquisitions between 2018-2024. Through participant observation, semi-structured interviews, and analysis of corporate communications, this research reveals how mandatory after-work drinking sessions become sites of cultural negotiation, resistance, and eventual hybrid practice formation. The study contributes to literature on cross-cultural management by demonstrating how alcohol-mediated bonding rituals, while effective in high-context cultures, require significant modification when transplanted to low-context cultural environments with strong work-life boundaries.

### 1. Introduction

The acquisition of Polish technology firms by Korean conglomerates in the early 2020s created unprecedented challenges in corporate cultural integration. While existing literature extensively documents West-East business culture clashes (Hofstede, 2001; Meyer, 2014), the specific intersection of Korean hierarchical drinking culture with Polish post-socialist work-life separation remains understudied. This ethnographic account, compiled from eighteen months of fieldwork across three Korean-owned firms in Warsaw, examines how hweshik—the Korean practice of mandatory after-work drinking sessions—becomes a contested terrain where competing cultural values negotiate new forms of corporate sociality.

As a Korean-Polish cultural consultant embedded within these organizations, I occupied a unique position as both participant and observer, translator and mediator. This dual identity, while presenting methodological challenges addressed in Section 3, provided unparalleled access to both Korean management perspectives and Polish employee resistance strategies. The resulting analysis reveals not merely a clash of drinking cultures, but fundamental differences in conceptualizations of work, hierarchy, trust, and the boundaries between professional and personal life.

### 2. Literature Review

#### 2.1 Hweshik in Korean Corporate Culture

Hweshik, literally translated as "company dining," represents far more than simple after-work socialization. Scholars of Korean business culture (Park & Lee, 2019; Choi, 2021) identify hweshik as a crucial mechanism for building nunchi (눈치)—the ability to gauge social situations and hierarchies through subtle cues. In the Korean context, alcohol serves as a social lubricant that temporarily relaxes rigid hierarchical structures, allowing for communication patterns impossible during regular work hours (Kim, 2018).

The practice involves multiple stages, each with distinct social functions:
- **Il-cha (첫차)**: First round, typically dinner with beer or soju, where formal hierarchies remain largely intact
- **I-cha (이차)**: Second round, often karaoke, where performative vulnerability builds trust
- **Sam-cha (삼차)**: Third round, usually continued drinking, where "true feelings" (진심) emerge

Recent studies (Lee & Park, 2022) suggest hweshik serves three primary functions in Korean corporations:
1. Information exchange outside formal channels
2. Loyalty testing and team cohesion building  
3. Stress relief through collective intoxication

However, globalization has prompted scrutiny of hweshik's darker aspects, including its role in perpetuating gender discrimination, enabling workplace bullying, and contributing to South Korea's problematic drinking statistics (WHO, 2023).

#### 2.2 Polish Post-Socialist Work Culture

Polish corporate culture, shaped by both socialist legacy and rapid post-1989 marketization, maintains strict boundaries between work and personal life (Kostera, 2020). Unlike Korean collectivist approaches, Polish workplace relationships typically follow what Sztompka (2019) terms "ceremonial distance"—professional courtesy without personal intimacy.

Key characteristics of Polish work culture include:
- Emphasis on individual competence over group harmony
- Suspicion of mandatory social activities (legacy of communist-era forced collectivism)
- Strong protection of personal time through labor laws
- Drinking as private social activity, not professional obligation

The Polish approach to workplace alcohol reflects broader European trends toward separation of professional and personal spheres (Brewster & Mayrhofer, 2021), contrasting sharply with Asian integration models.

#### 2.3 Cross-Cultural Alcohol Practices in Business

Anthropological studies of alcohol in business contexts (Wilson, 2018; Douglas, 2020) reveal drinking rituals as powerful markers of inclusion and exclusion. In high-context cultures, shared intoxication creates temporary communitas—a liminal state where normal social structures dissolve and reform. However, when imposed across cultural boundaries, these same rituals can become what Bourdieu (1984) termed "symbolic violence"—the imposition of cultural arbitrary through seemingly voluntary participation.

### 3. Methodology

This study employs multi-sited ethnography (Marcus, 1995) across three Korean-owned technology firms in Warsaw:
- **TechCore Polska** (acquired 2019): 340 employees, 85% Polish
- **Digital Dynamics Warsaw** (acquired 2020): 220 employees, 80% Polish
- **Quantum Solutions** (acquired 2021): 180 employees, 75% Polish

Data collection methods included:
1. **Participant observation**: 47 hweshik events over 18 months
2. **Semi-structured interviews**: 67 participants (42 Polish, 25 Korean)
3. **Document analysis**: Internal communications, HR policies, anonymous feedback
4. **Digital ethnography**: Analysis of informal WhatsApp groups and online forums

My position as a cultural consultant provided legitimate presence at these events while my mixed heritage facilitated code-switching between Korean management and Polish employees. This insider-outsider status, while advantageous for access, required constant reflexivity regarding my own cultural biases and mediating role.

### 4. Findings

#### 4.1 The Implementation Phase: Cultural Shock and Misrecognition

Initial attempts to implement hweshik in Polish subsidiaries revealed profound cultural misrecognition. Korean managers, operating from what they considered universal business practices, failed to anticipate Polish resistance to mandatory after-hours socialization.

**Case Study 1: The TechCore Incident**

Director Kim Sung-ho's arrival at TechCore Polska in March 2021 marked an aggressive attempt at cultural integration. His mandate for weekly hweshik sessions triggered what employees later called "the vodka rebellion." Field notes from the third mandatory session capture the mounting tension:

> *10:47 PM, Restaurant Silla, Private Room 3: The atmosphere is thick with unspoken resistance. Polish employees cluster defensively, speaking rapid Polish whenever Kim approaches. Tomasz, a senior developer, has been nursing the same beer for two hours, refilling it with water during bathroom breaks. When Kim notices and insists on pouring him soju, Tomasz's hands shake—not from intimidation but suppressed rage. "In Poland," he says quietly, "forcing someone to drink is assault." The translator hesitates, softens the words. The damage is done.* (Field notes, March 18, 2021)

This incident, culminating in Tomasz's hospitalization for diabetes complications, became a watershed moment. The event spread through Polish tech circles as a cautionary tale of cultural imperialism, while Korean management saw it as individual weakness rather than systemic failure.

#### 4.2 Resistance Strategies: The Polish Arsenal

Polish employees developed sophisticated resistance strategies that revealed deep cultural resources for subverting authority while maintaining surface compliance. These tactics, refined through generations of navigating authoritarian systems, proved remarkably effective against Korean hierarchical pressure.

**Taxonomy of Resistance Tactics:**

1. **Medical Exemptions**: Employees shared lists of medications incompatible with alcohol, coached each other on symptoms, and developed networks of sympathetic doctors.

2. **Religious Conversion**: Six employees at Digital Dynamics claimed religious conversions preventing alcohol consumption. Orthodox Christianity proved particularly effective due to Korean unfamiliarity with its practices.

3. **Strategic Photography**: Volunteers documented events extensively, using camera equipment as shields against drinking pressure. One employee, Małgorzata, became legendary for her ability to appear busy photographing while avoiding alcohol entirely.

4. **Bathroom Coordination**: Polish employees developed elaborate bathroom schedules, using WhatsApp to coordinate absences that prevented complete rounds of toasts.

5. **The Reverse Hweshik**: In the most sophisticated resistance, employees at Quantum Solutions enthusiastically over-served Korean managers while moderating their own consumption, effectively neutralizing leadership through their own cultural weapon.

**Interview Extract - Małgorzata N., Marketing Manager:**

> "We're Polish. We survived partition, two world wars, communism. You think we can't handle a few Korean managers trying to make us drink? Please. My grandmother smuggled food under Nazi occupation. I can smuggle water in a soju bottle." (Interview, June 15, 2021)

This historical consciousness—framing hweshik resistance within longer patterns of Polish survival—emerged repeatedly in interviews. Employees drew parallels between mandatory drinking and communist-era forced celebrations, activating cultural scripts of superficial compliance masking deeper resistance.

#### 4.3 Management Perspectives: Lost in Translation

Korean managers expressed genuine bewilderment at Polish resistance, revealing fundamental misunderstandings about cultural transferability. Many operated from what they considered benevolent paternalism, viewing hweshik as gift-giving rather than imposition.

**Interview Extract - Park Min-jun, Integration Director:**

> "In Korea, hweshik shows we care about employees as whole people, not just workers. We share our hearts through soju. But Polish colleagues treat it like punishment. They don't understand we're trying to include them in our family." (Interview, August 3, 2021)

This familial metaphor appeared repeatedly in Korean management discourse, contrasting sharply with Polish preferences for professional distance. Where Koreans saw inclusion, Poles experienced intrusion. Where Koreans offered vulnerability, Poles perceived weakness to exploit.

The cultural gulf widened through misinterpreted signals. Korean managers read Polish formal politeness as coldness requiring more aggressive integration efforts. Polish employees interpreted Korean emotional displays as unprofessionalism or manipulation. Each side's attempts to bridge differences often widened them.

#### 4.4 The Mediation Phase: Hybrid Forms Emerge

By late 2021, the acute conflict phase gave way to grudging accommodation and eventually creative hybridization. This transformation occurred through several mechanisms:

**Cultural Brokers**: Mixed-heritage employees and those with cross-cultural experience became invaluable mediators. They translated not just language but cultural logic, helping each side understand the other's perspective without necessarily accepting it.

**Policy Evolution**: HR departments, facing potential legal challenges and retention crises, developed compromise policies:
- Quarterly rather than weekly events
- Two-drink maximums
- Optional third rounds
- Alternative bonding activities (coffee meetings, lunch sessions)

**Ritual Innovation**: Some teams developed entirely new traditions combining elements from both cultures:
- "Pierogi & Soju" nights with Polish food and Korean drinks
- Karaoke sessions featuring both Polish patriotic songs and K-pop
- Team-building through competitive video gaming (acceptable to both cultures)

**Case Study 2: The Vodka-Soju Summit**

The most successful integration occurred at Quantum Solutions through what participants later called the "Vodka-Soju Summit." After months of tension, Polish and Korean employees organized their own cultural exchange:

> *The private room at Restauracja Polska buzzes with nervous energy. Tables laden with both Korean anju and Polish zakąski. Someone suggests alternating toasts—Polish "Na zdrowie" followed by Korean "Geonbae." The accounting manager brings out her grandmother's homemade pickles, explaining their hangover prevention properties. A Korean developer responds with kimchi from his mother. Suddenly, everyone is sharing family remedies, bonding over the universal experience of hangover management. By evening's end, they've created their own ritual—the "Kim-Pol Toast," combining elements of both cultures while respecting individual limits.* (Field notes, December 10, 2021)

This organic hybridization succeeded where top-down implementation failed, suggesting the importance of employee agency in cultural integration.

### 5. Analysis: Theoretical Implications

#### 5.1 Power, Performance, and Resistance

The hweshik conflicts illustrate Goffman's (1959) dramaturgical approach to social interaction, with participants performing cultural scripts while maintaining hidden transcripts of resistance (Scott, 1990). Polish employees became adept at performing compliance while subverting actual participation, revealing the limits of managerial power to enforce genuine cultural change.

The resistance strategies employed drew on what Certeau (1984) called "tactics"—the weapons of the weak that operate within imposed strategic frameworks. Unable to reject hweshik outright, Polish employees transformed it through creative reinterpretation, maintaining agency within structural constraints.

#### 5.2 Alcohol as Cultural Boundary Object

Following Star and Griesemer's (1989) concept of boundary objects, alcohol in these contexts served multiple simultaneous functions:
- For Korean managers: Trust-building medium and hierarchy solvent
- For Polish employees: Professional boundary violation and health threat
- For the organization: Integration challenge requiring creative solutions

The same substance carried radically different meanings across cultural contexts, making simple transfer of practices impossible. Successful integration required creating new shared meanings around alcohol's role in professional settings.

#### 5.3 Hybridization vs. Domination

The evolution from conflict to hybrid practices supports Bhabha's (1994) theory of cultural hybridization over simple domination narratives. Rather than Korean practices overwhelming Polish resistance or vice versa, a "third space" emerged where new forms of corporate sociality developed.

These hybrid forms—quarterly events with drinking limits, alternative bonding activities, employee-led cultural exchanges—represent neither Korean nor Polish traditions but something distinctly new. This emergence suggests possibilities for genuine cultural innovation in cross-border corporate contexts.

### 6. Discussion: Practical Implications

#### 6.1 For Management Practice

The findings suggest several principles for managing cross-cultural integration:

1. **Recognize Cultural Practices as Systems**: Hweshik cannot be extracted from broader Korean hierarchical culture and simply transplanted. Practices carry cultural logic that may be incompatible with receiving contexts.

2. **Enable Employee Agency**: Top-down cultural imposition triggers resistance. Successful integration emerged when employees co-created new practices.

3. **Respect Legal and Cultural Boundaries**: Polish labor laws protecting personal time reflect deeper cultural values. Ignoring these invites both legal challenges and cultural backlash.

4. **Develop Cultural Translators**: Invest in employees who can bridge cultural divides, explaining not just what but why practices matter to each side.

#### 6.2 For Cultural Theory

The study contributes to understanding how globalization creates new spaces for cultural negotiation. Rather than simple domination or resistance, we observe complex processes of translation, adaptation, and innovation. The Polish-Korean case suggests that even seemingly incompatible cultural practices can generate creative syntheses when participants have agency in the process.

The role of alcohol as a contested medium highlights how material practices carry different cultural loads. Future research might explore other boundary objects in cross-cultural management—food, time, space, technology—that become sites of cultural negotiation.

### 7. Conclusion

The attempted implementation of hweshik in Polish subsidiaries of Korean corporations reveals fundamental challenges in cross-cultural management. What began as cultural imposition evolved through conflict and resistance into hybrid forms that honored both Korean emphasis on relationship-building and Polish insistence on work-life boundaries.

The study's key contribution lies in documenting not just conflict but creative adaptation. Polish employees' sophisticated resistance strategies, Korean managers' eventual flexibility, and the emergence of new synthetic practices suggest possibilities for genuine multicultural corporate environments. However, these possibilities require recognizing cultural practices as embedded systems rather than transferable tools.

As one Polish developer summarized: "We learned to toast with soju while keeping our Polish souls. They learned to respect our limits while sharing their hearts. Maybe that's integration—not becoming them or making them us, but creating something new together."

Future research should explore whether these hybrid forms prove stable over time or represent temporary accommodations. Additionally, examining similar cultural negotiations in other Korean-European contexts could reveal whether the Polish case represents a unique configuration or broader pattern.

The hweshik wars, as employees termed them, ultimately produced neither Korean victory nor Polish defeat but a negotiated peace where both soju and vodka could coexist—consumed in moderation, with mutual respect, and always with good zakąski.
